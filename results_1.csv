@XavsFutbol It's about the strategy, Zidane has been playing with the same " Crossing " technique for ages now, it's clearly not working now and he is still stuck on it, the team had no communication just bad performance
@KantosKetchum I speak overpowered mother"Go to your room. No internet for a week."
@KarenCivil @Kehlani Producer @EricGgg recalled Mac freestyling the first half of “2009”: “He did the first whole half of the song in a pitch-black booth with no phone or anything. I don’t even know how he did it, and for it to be so meaningful.” https://t.co/ASpHmfEg3U
@jeremyarroyo @Yankees I remember my dad at the time, with no internet to fact-check, would mess with me by telling me the Yankees were going to trade him because he refused to get a haircut.This wasn't true... was it?As a sidebar... my mom was disgustingly in love with Dennis Eckersley.
You can be in the middle of civilization and you’d still have no signal with sprint. Worst provider I swear 🤦🏻‍♂️
@SkyHelpTeam Last week it went off because ‘no signal’ and the same thing has happened again tonight. A team of people couldn’t help when we rang, all they could do was ask us to pay more money on top of the £83 a month we currently pay,for something that is not working!
I’m really out here with no phone case just raw dogging it
@PlayStation No internet connection
@magneteach @sirDukeDevin Two Hundred and more years ago, with no e-mail, no TV and no internet, the Electoral College made a lot of sense, but today it makes no sense atall!
@Ryanair I understand we can't avoid the extremities of nature somethings. But the complete lack of organisation, no communication, and the fact 44 people were left stranded outside the airport waiting for a bus for 3 hours... Including 2 newborns. That's ridiculous and not OK!
Wow havent been on twitter no phone what did i miss
@sprintcare Over 2 hours and still no phone, what ...a...joke 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 https://t.co/BExAACKwsh
@ATT sure would be nice if you guys did what you say you would do. This in now twice I have schedule to have service turned on at my place and no one has shown up. No tech. No phone. No show and still NO SERVICE! Very frustrating.

@PhillyBobcat Jesus Christ. I'm also on work computer, because no phone.
@itgirljihyo When the boys got accused for pl@giarising the No signal vcr from t0p solo concert, their staff uploaded a pic of that performance on insta and captioned it with "hmmmm.... OUR hard-work"T0p's brother and another member's sister in law liked it. This encouraged VIPs to bully

@washingtonpost Lucky those who are above 40. They have made many stupidity but there was no internet and therefore there are no evidences.
@tomiahonen Definitely no internet or twitter! He will go even more stark raving mad when he can’t hear or see anything being said about him! (Did you notice how I left out the word “read?”) 😂
@Arcaxon @FredInTheKnud Finally! Been wanting an OS with no Internet capabilities and a better than realistic elephant.

@BestBuySupport My laptop is being sent to a service repair center which I found out by email and no phone call to update me on this before hand. I call the store only to be answered, transferred and hung up on, to then be asked for survey on my satisfaction. Are you serious?
@zuninja754 @PlayApex @EAHelp Wow. It is listed in literally every other place except for origin. I haven’t even wanted to play this game because of this. No communication and then finally I’m told just wait for it, eventually it might work out?! Not ok @EAHelp   Not ok.
@AmazonHelp @amazonIN @amazonhelp I rcvd emails that delivery was attempted when there was no phone call/message rcvd. This is falsified communication which can go against the company. You're open to cross validate with your internal comms systems
@AMDGaming no internet, somethin from the Civilization series.  internet, ESO probably.
No phone book in room.  https://t.co/nGvkp876rB not helping me find phone # of an old military friend.  Darn it.  Have the night to myself here in Vegas.
@IndiGo6E you have made a mockery out of your passenger. Because of your on ground crew. Me &amp; My colleague gets to not board the flight 6E-185 even after checking in 3hrs prior. due to lag of no communication between your on ground crew. #worstairlines #indigoairlines #airport
@sektor it gives us signal, if theres no cable then we can’t watch bc no signal KEKW

Sitting in a parking lot waiting to see hot air balloons and I have little to no signal...
@iWilliiam @BenGeskin @91mobiles No phone yet has a smaller hole than the Note 10. And S11 will be even smaller.
Third grade level! For a career politician, Nancy has "NO" communication skills in a room full of men &amp; "REAL" agenda.

@ChoeNut This person pretended to care when I was at my lowest &amp; once I got boring, she said it wasn't fun anymore &amp; she ended  the friendship. Via text, no phone call or anything. This was a life lesson to help me recognize future frauds.
@sonicmeerkat Lol what are you a caveman? Get into the 21st Century grandad!Wait... my phone charge is dying... no phone, stay with me - I must continue Tweeting and get home bef
@NitrateVille I looked into this. No internet here but Comcast, cutting to just internet and adding a streaming tv service is roughly the same price as keeping the service I have, and the cloud DVR services on streaming are extremely limited
No internet connection here on campus so the Moroccan midget, Fatwhale, Monkeyass &amp; Military perps are on the run with their subs getting spots and creating hyperlinks in order to shoot EMF at me which they tried twice at this very moment 150 degrees hitting my right ankle... https://t.co/kbCdT8ZLPF
@joswinson There was no signal to send the email in the ditch. Carrier pigeon only. It'll arrive in the EU in the next few weeks.

INJUSTICE: I've seen racism first hand &amp; today was my 2nd #DrivingWhileBlack for "running 🛑" &amp; "no signal" 🤷‍♀️ BS it was 2 black men that's why. They "smelled drugs". Cuffed them, had me sit in back of car. Found 0️⃣. Was I ok? Why? Because w/ Black Men? 🖕🐷Just sad and angry.
@TwinTemple Exactly! Unfortunately, the key words are intellect and knowledge. There was a time we had to seek this information out. There was no internet. Always breaking down and exploring. It pleases me to do it respectfully. Love you guys! Ave! 😈
@belindagrant80 Sorry Belinda, not today. But I'm here having my coffee now, and then I have to go and pack for a few days away with my parents. No internet access, poor mobile phone coverage, so probably no Twitter. But I'll be with you all in spirit.
SO IM PHONELESS
@KensingtonRoyal Please visit Indian Occupied Kashmir, the state has been sieged by Indian forces, it is a desperate humaitarian situation. 72 years of occupation and since 5th Aug the Kashmiris have no communication, no medical supplies and are being tortured.
@ThreeUK I want to leave your network. No signal or just shitty in general...at times when I most needed it and your customer service is even worse!!!!!!!!
@josayye1 @gvbbylvls @Kkaylahernandex Having a good time no phone in sight, photographic memory more liek
@BrynLaw @ben_parker19 @LUFC @andrearadri @leedsunitedtv @JayMooney86 What's happening about everyone who paid for LUTV today but got no stream and no communication from the club? Nothing has been mentioned.

@VicVanquish Bruh you got a phone. Back in my day rehab meant no phone 😭
@softhiin This person really needs help... and no internet connection..
I woke up this morning in someone else’s shirt, my rings on the wrong finger, hair a mess and NO PHONE. I’m thinking “i lost my phone it’s probably in Mexico already” haha. I just wanna talk to the person who let me get drunk.. 🥴
@JoeUrquhartYEP Just a shame LUTV messed up and didn't work so we missed seeing this, all other celebrations, and lost importantly, the game. Still no communication from the club about it, loads of pissed off fans @andrearadri @LUFC , no word on refunds. @GrahamSmyth @LeedsNews
Did this last night at dinner after teaching. Only seat left at lovely bay-beside restaurant, Saltwater Fish, was corner barstool. Just sat...calmed out. No book, no writing, no phone.

@Flow no internet @cooperage for a week now
So uh about the video. My dad yeeted my phone and said no phone while on the hike so I didnt record anything.... Sorry gamers maybe next time smh
@emileighsrose Bands did a lot of stupid shit in the day to get noticed. There was no internet to beat them down for it. It was all about selling records, not downloads.

@Reuters I like this lady.   She is on the ball.  Not trying to bullshit the American people.  Freedom first.  No  communication with Area 51 .   Wacko’s

Aur mari ex ka connection Ptcl ke taraa ta connect taa but no internet  (no feelings for me) https://t.co/KAl2BMGVIf
@MissAshes92 Glad to hear there is a gate. I haven't passed there in a while. This is a good site for a camera, compared to radar/laser gauges. Agree, underwater gauges are more susceptible to water and debris damage, and thus a false or no signal. You can tie that in to ATX.Floods.
@xSoulHunterDKx @DayZ @NakedByo For them to make it this far. Without the people who purchased the game, they wouldn't be where they are. It's a great game, incredible in my own opinion. But for about a week, it's been in a broken state, with no communication on the situation. Only a sales pitch. Not cool.
@annakhachiyan Somewhere with no internet connection
I can't watch any streams!!😦 I literally have only 2gb of data left... Having no internet is hard!! I have to act like a human! https://t.co/lQ7vOK9MyG

Just thought up of a nice idea for a #Kenshi Halloween mod as part of the community discord event! Will work on it while my desktop has no Internet connection :)
@Asmali77 Kenyans jameni,question/answer and no communication
@snsachinnandu @oyorooms I had the same experience. Booked hotel with OYO at Haridwar and Gangotri for my parents. After reaching there, they came to know that those hotels have discontinued their relationship with OYO. There was no communication to us.
the only people more annoying than exols are 2nd generation stans bc in their time there was no internet so they were fighting physically and writing their drags down in notebooks and now we all suffering from 20th century jokes
chris you said you can be my boyfriend, well: BE MY BF AND LET ME SLEEP AT YOURS NEXT SATURDAY CAUSE MY BROTHER JUST KICKED ME OUT AND I HAVE TO GO TO MY GRANDPARENTS with no internet and other problematic stuff
@mrcollins_o No battery = no phone
@TheCriminalRose It had been months indeed, and unfortunately for them, things hadn't ended in the best of ways.Actually, they hadn't even ended.There was no closure, no communication.He didn't know where Neo had gone to,And he truly didn't want to know anyway. +
I'm working in a pop culture event and no signal of a Madeline/Badeline cosplay, i'm so disappointed
@Shizzle1124 @pulte Yeah i can see that...i honestly havent seen anyone who has won the money...i keep seeing these but never see videos of the winners..no phone calls SS or anything..so im leary of these
Was that a bout of nomophobia, @evolvingTLS? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a great idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #usecase

@TanTran__ @ATT dude..... i woke up devastated because i had no internet
How the fuck did I agree to this phoneless speakeasy bullshit DURING SATURDAY FOOTBALL?!?!?!?!?
@Asameow17 @HeyRhett @kaye_el_bie @kissdeo02 Fans muna.. no phone for ML lol
@BSNLCorporate I guess bsnl is purposefully shutting down the internet in Karnataka, Bangalore, vijayanagar, if I call the customer service they ask me me call some other time, no use complaining in the exchange near me. They didn't resolve my prob. No internet from a week ..
@ladyrelodsalot @elgatogaming It’s not just in OBS though, it was saying no signal, now it’s just a black screen. In OBS and the elgato game capture app.

@AirtelNigeria despite full network signal on my phone, the recently purchased mifi has no internet access barely 2 wks after recharging. The same problem encountered soon after purchase of the mifi. Any solution to this? Many thanks.
@scottros @margaretomara What a great piece! Thanks for sharing. You put your finger on the tensions that most observers weren't thinking about for another 20 years. As for §230, we don't need to excuse misconduct to reverse the Stratton decision. The safe harbor is overbroad.https://t.co/dfw0tln3tK
@amy_tisi Strange that there was no signal eh?
I'm home now It was fun and all but it's good to be back I had no internet there too --"But hey I'm here,I'm safe
Not no texting to make sure i was straight, no phone calls, i mean physically 🖤💯 that’s my dawg 4L
@Hermesparcels have waited in all day for a parcel that was to be delivered between 8am and 6pm and at 8pm nothing had arrived and there has been no communication. This is appalling customer service.
T-mobile boasts having 650 shops. But company is compromised by the lack of service on weekends! They offer a solution to problem - no signal , in 3 days. Big company shit and lack of competence of the Board. In communication services 8 hours is eternity and a complete disaster !
@LucySetonW Just got out of hot bath and have glass of wine. I’ll post some pics later. Had almost no signal most of the day, and got drenched and dazzled so pics not great. We will be doing this again, I’m sure. Xx
@LaurenGermanArg @JaneHil52691644 Hahahahaha !!!You're crazy!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻However, I'm at my parents, in the middle of the countryside, it's so lost that we have almost no internet signal, it is a torture to read your tweets, I think I will have to leave...

@BarbKaplitz @HeatherLinda11 @SparlingAngela Our experience is changes on pain medication and other stigmatized medications often no communication despite no reason.
@iGoBiTima @ATTHelp @ATT @GetSpectrum Probably. Our phone is connected to our internet. So no internet, no house phone. For months we would have times where we wouldn’t have service. It would start with outages for 30 minutes at a time up to the point it would be hours. Just tired of dealing with them.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Yeah. It’s in the basement with a secret door, and has no internet. https://t.co/GMYs8Q02Xh
@virginmedia is there an ongoing issue with broadband in the BD16 area? I’ve had numerous instances of no internet connection over the last week. Your app says that all’s fine with your service, your telephone message disagrees and says there’s an issue...any idea what’s going on
@karlmondon I remember that game well.  Washington was playing.  Back then, no internet, no big weather reports at your fingertips and no clue that wind was coming in the next day.
@Steph73_NL It's possible if it was trying to download an update to the walk that it was stuck waiting in an "I'm still downloading" state with no internet and not visible in my walks because of that.   If it's still not in My Walks, try re-running the app and doing "restore purchases".
@bt_uk I've gone 3 weeks with no internet and was really looking forward to having it again! It's like living in a cave!
@NickHunt7 i cant even do it. no internet😭😭😭😭
24hr no internet connection, enough

It’s funny I saw her at the (kinda) beginning (Lungs era REPRESENT) and at the latest and to see her growth vocals and performance wise was so amazing to witness (sadly I don’t have any vids from the first concert cause I had no phone). okay I’m done rambling
I remember when opening the browser icon on the phone was a big no no. Now if there is no internet for like a minute my phone is an idiot box https://t.co/rleoRQJ5io
Ladies, why do y’all send random pics out the blue after months of no communication.

Thought I was finna die wit no phone
@virginmedia Tried this but it doesn't do anything because there's no internet. Worse still just got back from a 13hr round trip to Liverpool traveling on a virgin train connected to virgin WiFi supplied by the train and couldn't connect with either 4g or WiFi
@IyIaah Thought you had no internet

Immediately you say "I Love you," .....she becomes cashless, phoneless, dataless, homeless, fatherless. All kinds of less!🤣🤣🤣
No phone or nothing like I just want peace
This generation has no communication skills... shit crazy 😂
@Steph73_NL Quite a lot of the routes have places with no internet at all so the app needs to work in no internet conditions.  All it needs is GPS (to be able to see the sky) during the walk.
@DakHarding We're in our rooms with no internet...
@Zuku_WeCare please fix account 871267 no Internet
@AnisTabet23 Only in Lebanon would the people be so disrespected to the point where after DAYS of protests, there’s no communication whatsoever from/about the president
@iwalkc I had my phone crash on me yesterday mid walk. I had no internet connection, so couldn’t reload my walk (no worries, I didn’t get lost). Is there a way to download my walks as a back up? Love your walks and the app!
@YeroTunder Yeah, when there's no internet around and I'm bored as hell 😆
Hate having no internet
And this is why it’ll never work 🤷🏾‍♀️ no communication
Woke up and only 2 notifications? Very disappointed in you people. Go to your rooms. No internet.
@BeSpleen @PamAinsley @kurteichenwald The difference from 1933 to 45 was, that these people were brainwashed by propaganda, there was no internet, no free press and hardly anyone travelled abroad. They believed the Nazi bullshit. Whoever believes the Trump lies and scaremongering is an idiot, a dangerous one, too !

@DrBeniRusani I don't know but we practice this. When we're going out together, no phone.. I mean, we still can take pictures or anything, but we use to talk, or staring at each other rather than playing with phone..
@MilaKunisNow Mila, return my call. Meaning actually pick the phone up and press on the key pad and dial my number so we can actually have conversation. We have been communicating for almost a year now. Still....no phone call! 1347-792-8575 ericaquino411@gmail.com. call meeeeee or email me.
There was no signal on the #PeoplesVoteMarch today. We made it to Parliament Sq due to some crafty shortcuts and heard the result of the #Letwin vote live. The roar from the crowd was awesome!

No communication by the #njdevils. So many lost pucks and battles because they don’t talk and get caught in no mans land. Look so disorganized.
In my ten plus years of using @ATT I've never been so disappointed in their customer service. No internet for six days. No help. No solutions. Looking to @verizon or @GetSpectrum for proper service if either is interested in a new customer.
Day 2 of no internet Still fuckin bored
@ACTFibernet In the evening, I called your customer care where (AGAIN!!!) I was given a false assurance that it will be fixed in sometime but there’s still no internet. Your services are pathetic &amp; stop lying and giving false assurance
@GaylyDreadful No, because I'm stuck in the studio all weekend with no internet 😭😭😭
Y’all I literally woke up at 7:30 and literally walked to I could t walk anymore. Lately myself has been so off of my normal life and routine that I’ve been so nervous. Today walking 7 miles I think I found clarity. No phone, music, distractions. Just me and Mother Nature 💕

@ThePublius2020 I personally would like to hope he doesn't get really sick and have a stroke and have to poop in a bag that he has to wheel around with him and cannot talk and gets stuck in a nursing home with MSNBC 24 hours a day and no internet or way to tweet. That'd be very terrible for him.
@darling_sammy Instead of the phantom vibration in pants pocket sensation, a phantom fleshy hand caressing you from inside your pocket
It's not that I love Android, because I don't. It's just that I don't like iOS. I tried the Ubuntuphone, but as soon I booted the thing for the first time, I saw the complete failure of it. So I went back to Android. It's either that or no phone at all. https://t.co/8WHHgsqzni

@Sidjohnsonnn It depends on when and where, but keep in mind there is zero support on for google fi issues. They will make you reboot your phone, buy new sim card before an "escalation" that takes 24-72hrs for response. That is a long time with no phone number.

@virginmedia No, she couldn’t tell us when it started or when it was going to be fixed. Just that it was due to an upgrade in the area and to call back in two days if we had no internet. And said we could see the outage details on our account page. Which we can’t :(
@lilferebee @chime bank has been down for almost 5 days. No communication from @Chime millions of customers can't access their money. And lots of money missing

@lizethnio6 Basically at the end of the day they all need to talk, and they will very quickly. This isn’t gonna be another Escort where there’s no communication. There will be certain things left unsaid for now, but from this point forward they’ll be pretty open and honest
Could you be without your cell phone for the day?  High school students and staff members at South Jefferson proved they could as part of “Phoneless Friday.”   https://t.co/2CJffby0po

Hey @cashapp ,How much money do you really save by not investing time and resources into @CashSupport ?No phone line? 48 hour email responses?Increase the transaction cost if you have to, this lack of support is a huge turnoff.

@Stillberto One of the most frustrating things about the way VAR is currently used is that there is no communication of the reasoning behind decisions. I would love to hear the conversation between the officials that resulted in that penalty not being given.

I saw a guy at Starbucks today.No tablet.No laptop.No phone. No lights. No motor cars.Not a single luxury. He just sat there.Drinking coconut water.Like a Robinson Crusoe, as primitive as can be.

@DaveVescio @BrandonJRouth @StephenAmell  That reminds me of this: “No phone, no lights, no motor carnot a single luxurylike Robinson Crusoe,it's primitive as can be.” 🤣🤣🤣
My favourite thing to do at the moment is go out with no phone like I used to, back in 1995, cos the phones were huge and cost $2 a minute to call people. Or if I do, make sure it's only at 10% power so I only use it in an emergency.
@Scala9111 That was two hours ago. No internet lol. We just landed! Thanks!❤⚘

@JioCare see this. We love Jio. Jio has revolutionized the telecom sectors, we should admit this. But still, I believe in Jio that's why I haven't ported my sim to other telecom.

Having no internet connection and to joke about it as a 1st world problem really bites you in the ass when you are at the receiving end of that joke. My entitled-self is internally screaming, no doubt.

@OpenreachHelp Hi Openreach attended my home on Wednesday to connect phonline/internet, was unable to connect due to external fault. An Openreach engineer was booked via EE for yesterday to connect my internet/phone line in N22 8DN. Today, I STILL have no internet/phonline.

@ThePublius2020 Trump doesn't need any books. He gets a television with two stations: Fox and RT. The internet with access to only Twitter. We want to be able to read about his brilliant thoughts.  No phone. A nine hole golf course with boulders strewn about and day old fast food and Moxie.

@dorydebby @StinsonHunter Suppose it’s all about trust but if you’re in contact with him then at least there’s communication so that’s something. When there’s no communication then u have no clue who’s there or what’s happening.

@BanKsEsports most importantly there was no internet to spoil the whole thing
@cbschicago I really wish you would address the issue on why #CBS #CBS2Chicago is the hardest channel in Chicago to pick up with an antenna. I had finally found a antenna position to get #CBS then we had to rescan all channels. Now the channel name shows up but still no signal.

Actually more nervous for this match because I’m not going. The annoying thing is, I would be going if my parents weren’t on holiday. Now I’m stuck at work with no phone between 1 and 5. Well at least when I finish the game will be over.
@KeithMillsD7 @Donnachain22 there is a conscious, deliberate &amp; sinister policy to sneak in hundreds of so-called 'asylum seekers' under dead of night into small villages around Ireland! No consultation, no communication, no choice!
The recent mess at @ThreeUK finally pushed me to move to a different carrier. Months of no internet in town centerMonths of adult filter blocking things even though it's offDozens of times on the phone with supportLasw few days were even worse. Bye @ThreeUK Hello @PlusNet
@SKYserves we have no internet connection today. Please check
the train passing a village with a pretty clean small river. i saw a grandma sitting on bamboo bench while the evening wind breezes softly. the other women washing clothes, bathed their children or simply just sit down in the edge. no phone in sight, just people enjoy their time.

Last two days there has been no 4G Signal - it’s almost 2020 and there’s no phone signal. Wondering how 5G will ever make it here.  @EE @legoland @cadburyworld #firstworldproblems
@sextoyspolitics I just went upstairs to watch it, it got like 30 seconds in and now it's stuck on an infinite load. Sometimes the internet here just doesn't work right. It's totally rediculous but it's this or no internet.
Bro is currently tweeting while crossing the Rajang river who says Sarawak has no signal pft
And again.... now I’m told @VodafoneUK can ONLY REQUEST! An engineer AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY meaning that I’ll have no internet for at least another 2 weeks! Because @WeAreOpenreach are actively not doing the reactive works for @VodafoneGroup
@SkyUK Months with intermittent broadband connection. 4 engineers. Hours and hours of phone calls. 22 different people telling me it will be fixed. And guess what. I wake up this morning and still no internet. Sky you are a joke. Equipment is going in the bin.
@loveshoeaholics supposed to have a delivery yesterday - nothing delivered. What’s the point of paying for next day delivery if it’s not delivered &amp; no communication 😬. Second time contacting with no response
@ThreeUKSupport still no signal what is going on
@peter_lord @tom_newton1234 @MartinRemains On the previous 2 marches there was no signal most of the time because everyone was trying to tweet. That, and people getting in the way of my bandwidth. 😂

Was that a bout of nomophobia, @XiuanL? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a nice idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #usecase
Hopeless customer service @asianetcabletv after upgrading to your digital TV I am suffering from bad picture quality, no signal issues everyday. Why am I paying you anything...last 3 days no cable even after making 10 to 30 calls to your customer service.
@ThreeUK so got up this morning and had WiFi calling in my house - took phone with me outside and came back to ‘no service’. Phone is useless without it as no signal in our village - please get it sorted!  Done all usual fixes ....

@Rumlino @SurbitonMoan @EE The whole Surbiton no signal, problem with a mast. #EE not in a rush to fix it
@MJairosi No signal is needed to be given to start the rebellion. Spontaneous reactions from people all over Zimbabwe will do. If you organise a date and place the junta will counter and put security or even ban. That's the reason why at any hint of protest police are thrown in the roads
@bt_uk Hi Paula, the pic shows what I should be getting (100m download and 10m upload minimum) My internet keeps dropping with no internet for hours at a time. Last night I had no internet for 6 hours.

@ThreeUK Please help me out here, my phone still has no signal despite turning it off and on countless times. I've even traveled from the I.O.W to Surrey with still no sign of any signal. To add to this, my three phone number was meant to be transferred from my old three sim
@DXdelivery for 3 days I’ve had my delivery booked in and promised within certain time and each has failed no communication. I have to collect from you today as I’ve stressed multiple times I need it this weekend. Shocking service!
Y’all be thinking cheating, lying etc are the reasons relationships end . No inconsistency, no communication, changing up how you treat them, not giving effort and more are also reasons and y’all don’t get that . https://t.co/6qLJir2o6H

@janemerrick23 Agree.  I remember being totally cut off in the countryside, no phone, new much wanted baby, pushing the pram along the unmade roads crying, everyone thought I was totally in control, organised and on the ball, mums must speak up, can have lifelong effects if they don’t ❤️
@nobucchika THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ME AND KEN ARE LEFT W NO INTERNET DURING THE DAY WE BECOME ACTUAL ANIMALS
@selfawaresoup @la_mafaldita Ever travelled from Munic into Austria? By train (DB...😭)? There is virually NO internet reception before crossing the Austrian border, except when finally reaching some town. But, as soon as in Austria, zack, 4G (to be fair, nothing in the tunnels on the Austrian side).
@DoT_India It's possible to Get UPC CODE for my old AIRCEL Number But unfortunately there is no signal is displaying but I need that number
I cant win.... finally got power back. Sti no internet. Woke up feeling like death. Sore throat and head ache and cough. Kill me
@shaunamkinney I used an online retailer from that area, and it took a week for my order to be dispatched. Almost no communication from them.Never again. shaking my fist ;-)
@iamanandd @naukarshah You are diverting the issue by taking it to a personal plain. Even if my mobile phone remains blocked, I shall not be silenced. Read the history of our freedom struggle? There was no phone, yet people protested. You people are indirectly helping two-nation theorists.

@licindiaDownloaded LICPayDirect app and tried it for an hour to pay a premium but failed as the App continuously showed lack of internet connection.If there was no internet connection,how could the App was downloaded and this Tweet posted?Is your App a junk joke on customers?
Wow @VodafoneGhana my broadband stopped working last night (second time this week)  and I was forced to sleep. I wake up and still no internet? Please give me back my internet, I paid for It.
@VOXI_UK thanks for screwing up my order! Despite my following instructions, you have transferred my old number to a sim that I don’t have 😡🤷‍♀️ and now refuse to transfer it to the Actual Sim that You Sent Me. WTF?? I am now meant to have no phone service for 3 days??
we're gonna have no signal once we get to the march on account of how many people will be there; we're counting on Remainers back home to spread the word for us!! 💪🇪🇺🇬🇧 #PeoplesVoteMarch https://t.co/JAnPI7kkwp

@Dorns84 Just staring at the side of your bonce. No communication 😂😂😂 final whistle goes “right, how is everyone?”
@IndiaPostOffice Went to post office yesterday. But as has been the case, no internet banking for my existing account. Thrice it has happened now, and twice after you have had given clear Instructions.
@colettebrowne People in communities have concerns, some of them legitimate, some of them based on ignorance, some of them abhorrently racist. Common theme seems to be a vacuum of planning and no communication plans or integration investment/plans from government. This needs to improve
@SafaricomPLC  why no internet access?
@helpmeunifi why still no internet? And expected recovery on 25/10/2019? https://t.co/q3mUKKhXOX
Terrible biz team. No contact forms, no communication. Just some punk in San Fran cancelling stuff with no explanation. Not reading 40 pages of confusing TOS because I PAID money to SUPPORT your business YOU accepted after analyzing my account. Money back!@TwitterBusiness https://t.co/Jok8RDgz6D

@SLTchat @andysquires1 Looking forward to this. Moving from a BYOD school in the US where phones were everywhere and we proved WiFi to students to England where phones are “banned” in classrooms and bad/no signal was a huge culture shock.

@DevilishDanni @instagram Well it's early days I suppose but no sign of anything just yet, wouldn't surprise me if no communication. I've emailed them, contacted them on here and Instagram itself. Time will tell
No electricity, no water, no internet  the whole day yesterday.  It gave me an opportunity to spend time with my family, they are actually very good and nice  people 🤩🤩#Zambia#LoadShedding
Succeed with no instagram for 2 weeks and now i was thinking to get this nokia phone so that i’m away from this socmed/smartphone thingy. But, sometime i was thinking its better to have no phone at all. #JustSaying https://t.co/yOmPNHL21M
Ugh. I have 3 days left to make this money or no internet. I'm just realizing this NOW of all times. Pray for me, I think sleep no longer counts as an option if I want to keep my internet on 😭😭😭 #help
Fuck me no signal for days actually about 5 minutes before saying oh you want it THATs the way forward.
@Bluestockingmum @woofit79 @BBCNews They always do. It's just normally we're all on the march with no signal.
@goibibo Your customer care agent raised a ticket and asked me to respond to the same email with files from my end (which I did). It has been two days now and there has been no communication after the initial phone conversation. How do I proceed?
@ACTFibernet Very bad service.  More than 30 hours no internet in home. Ticket No:SR10331469088262  . Almost 1 or 2 days in every week, I am facing internet failures. If this is the situation, I have to disconnect your services.
Not having no phone a different kinda ass

@VodafoneUK 11 days in total and next to nothing has been done. I get promised phone calls when things are done, but no phone call. I have to chase. Yet still nothing has been done. Poor customer service and I’ve tried complaining but heard nothing back!! Please sort this ASAP!!
@fuckkillyou2 Bro, i have no phone, im not using whatsapp anymore
@VodafoneIN multiple call drops! No signal!! Cant even get thru the 111 Vodafone care number to complaint!! Whats the solution??

@Sinkopedia I (and you probably) grew up as the internet became mainstream. We are all still adapting and only certain lines have become obvious, like no social media for those under 18.That said, porn blockers and a curated internet for those under 18 is understandable. No internet is not.
no phone for 1week
No communication, lack of loyalty got me dead ass lol
@SpotifyCares horrible support expect me to do their work no phone support
@Reignstradamus I looked it up and I was thinking of Green Bank, where there’s no internet cause they don’t want interference with Government Telescopes, my bad

I'm currently in an area with absolutely no internet, except for my mobile data I'm using to download #AHiTSwitchI took this into account just in case; I've been well prepared for this to be a reality. I have to go now so my Switch uses up my internet data and not Twitter https://t.co/zlTITcKKdp

Brenden Knox appeared to have scored on a 1-yard run, but no signal...it's ruled short. After play, Isaiah Green whistled for an unsportsmanlike conduct.Play is under review to see if Knox scored before penalty. If play stands, Herd will have 3rd-and-goal at 15 due to penalty.

@nuency25 @ClimateAudit @JupiterWalls @ombudsman4truth @sunmaster14 @ProfMJCleveland @HansMahncke There is no Presidential route for surveillance on US Persons, it’s a myth. That is for authorizing surveillance on enemy facilities that have no communication with Americans, so like a Russian Navy base.
Same is happening with me account no#1145374633, @HathwayBrdband  your network sucks..for last 10 day there is network issue. Either there is no internet for hours or when it comes it gets disconnected very soon..using @JioCare or @Airtel_Presence  hotspot for internet. https://t.co/ly4q5pZxHH
@trey_sheppard @shadxjose Bruh . Smh no phone or nothing
having no phone is really ass
@WizardWhistle No phone is more durable than another tbh. Put on a tempered glass, use a good case, and dont bring it near water ever. Phone batteries will always degrade with time/use but the Note 10 battery is the best out of these choices.
@pammy3006 agreed. Just a term created.  The old days was no phone call returned.
Let me just hop on lea- oh yeah, no internet Let me play smash onli- haha...Well I’ll just watch some ani- fuck

In 1999, NASA lost communication with the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter. A contractor had written a program for the orbiter using imperial units, as is standard in the U.S., but NASA’s software used the metric system. https://t.co/CiIgbjHHZM our @charles_duan in @Slate

@VZWSupport Both. Some places outdoors we get no signal. Same with indoors. Dropped calls, no service, etc. If we move to certain areas in the house, we get at most three bars. It’s been going on since we have had smartphones-years.
@OptimumHelp I AM REPAIRED! KUDOS TO EMILE! HE WAS HERE ALL AFTERNOON! How do I get a credit for all the time that my service has been going in and out? Almost 2 months! One day I had no service, the next day I had tv but no phone or internet, the next it was vice versa! Two long months!

What is the thought process whereby a person decides to text another person they barely know after 4 yrs of no communication? Do ppl just scroll through their contacts and randomly text ppl? I'm curious abt this but not curious enough to respond to the random that just texted me https://t.co/69Q2B3AJH0
@pulte @PulteDaily I might be without power and all contact if pg&amp;e moves their shutoff line even half a mile, no phone Wi-Fi nothing. A cheap hotel for the weekend would be a blessing

@aurajinallamour Exactly!!!! I always told myself I would never treat my kids how my mom did us . There distant love and no communication in this house . It's so crazy but I've grown out of having feelings towards that it literally doesn't effect me anymore . Sometimes you have to grow up before

#DanfoNigeria’s symbol of anyhowness.The buses have no signal lights or mirrors. They always look beat-up, they deface our roads. Everyday, someone is bashed by a danfo. The drivers are not licensed, you can’t do anything to them. But everyone is just causally ignoring. https://t.co/P1xNr8IHjt

@AmazonHelp Fire stick is plugged into TV and power power source (wall). TV set to hdmi, no signal. Fire stick won't turn on. Power cord was tested and is fine. Hdmi adapter was tested and is fine. TV hdmi port was tested and is fine.Seems the issue is the stick itself.

@Tesla ...with repeated followups till 10/23, i was told there was no loaner available and on 10/24 all followups stopped from SC. No phone calls were returned to me either. Is this how you guys treat customers who spend a $100 Grand on a car, you should be shameful.!
@_heylauren Worst part is no communication from the devs at all at least address to the community you know of/ are working on the issues or if they feel like it is something that they don’t want to take out the game at least tell us so we all don’t have to tweet out the same issues :(
highly considering going phoneless 2020

@PurolatorHelp No card...no phone call...please examine how I'm suppose to know I have a package in!? Most times I don't even know which courier a company is shipping to us with. I have to run all over town trying to find my packages. I will insist on companies not using Purolator to avoid this
Week two with no phone and it’s been a struggle
@PurolatorHelp There was no card. So no card, no phone call. Am I suppose to be a mind reader?? 2 WEEKS IT WAS THERE. So I finally go get it and with my back out, carry the 70 lb. package up the stairs.  If this was the first time this happened that would be one thing but it has happened before

@VZWSupport I have no internet service and can only get one or two bars. I was bumped up to another rep who assured me that verizon wasn't throttling me. He had me swap out my Sim Card, but that didn't aolve the problem. This has been an escalating issue for about a year.
@paul_winginit It's great no phone signal you can relax. Nothing reason why i like not having WiFi on flights not forced to check my emails
No internet since 10am TTuTT/So most likely there will be no stream tonight, might take this time to doodle or try not to get sick xbsjfbna

@sarahzj one of my favorite things on business travel is to sit, silently, in my hotel room. no phone, no television, no music. just silence.
When you crack your phone screen and @USCellular says they will overnight you a new phone: 😊When its been 5 days and no phone so you call back and get told "oh, they didn't tell you they were backordered? Our bad. We don't know when you will get one": 😠 Thanks USCellular 🙄

Nothing makes me feel old like hearing my husband explain to my daughter there was no internet, smart phones or Netflix when we were kids.
Over 50+ days no internet and today was our drop team appointment and they no showed. Again. For the third time. How is this an escalation @TELUS @TELUSsupport ? I think you’re lying to us. How does your drop team no show 3 appointments in a row and over 50 days straight?
I can’t with ESOL students man😭 one goes to his friend “Thor fono signal ar ni beh amar tath ‘no signal’ aya boythakseh” 😩😂😂😂

@SonicTelecoms Hi Sonic, less than 48 hours into a new Contract with no signal. I want out now. Please come and collect your Installation materials.
@sebas05000 @ari_bloch @JohnLegere @NevilleRay Typically poor quality SINR and RSRQ I suspect are the issues in this area.  Looks like T-Mobile must be actually working on it today - no signal from that site.. but typically getting 3/5 'bars' from a site up on the hill.  Overlay in this area may be the key.
glad i don’t fw no internet ass nigga, y’all be embarrassing yourselves on this app

This ain’t no phone plan when I put my brothers on
@AITA_reddit YTA, she has literally no idea why you’re acting like this due to no communication of past feelings of any sort. I’ve had a few guy pals I was close with from hs I tried to reconnect w/ that were rude n cold to me, most likely cuz Im married now. Friendship ain’t enough for some
@Ask_Spectrum so 5 days no phone or internet in Charlotte NC for me and my neighbor's. Is there a reason for this?

Dear #RealEstate industry,You really need to start putting the ISP's available and the internet speed packages available where a house is located. It's just as, if not more important, than the school systems. I wouldn't move to a house that has slow/no internet.
@SunTrust Hey Suntrust fraud department , when I disputed a transaction 2 weeks ago, and now you finally decide to fix it, how about letting your customer know you shut down their debit card instead of letting them find out in public.  No email...no phone call...you suck.  0 NPS.
Is Victoria's Secret an alternate dimension, or something. That's what it feels like. And there's no signal in here, but there is everywhere else in the mall.

@RiotL4T3NCY @Mortdog Turning a team score of 2-14 from complete loss, tilt and no communication into a team that worked together in the end. Myself and 2 other members remained positive and gave our all, eventually the others followed, this game promoted me into platinum for the first time. 👌🏼
There’s no signal in this bitch
@selenagomezsax @selenagomez Cape Town = Load shedding = no internet connectivity😭😭
@mattliebowitz @ATT Seriously, though...all these years, I've been paying ATT for "Cell phone service" while all I've had was the grace of broadband service??? No internet connection, no cell coverage. What exactly was I paying for?

@DaddyHoggy Had to get it working on old laptop XP SP1 with no Internet connection. Took perseverance &amp; about 3 hours.

@R0zzyB0wden @JuddLegum It’s not just Facebook. It’s the dominant cyberlibertarian credo of Silicon Valley. Barlow published the playbook back in 1996–The Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace.

@bt_uk Already ran the checks and it’s an issue outside the home. It says estimated fix of Wednesday, no internet that whole time?
Not only is government NOT the problem, it’s actually the only tool we have to combat the largest problems facing man-kind. We can not tackle things like climate change, poverty, etc.. without it. Without the government there would be no internet, GPS, society as we know it.
@martolinakiwi @LATAM_PER I'm in the same line. Since 10:30am and now 2:49. No communication from @LATAM_PER to passengers in line. Safety is one thing; customer service is another.

Received an email from a temp agency last night for a great short term assignment. I replied with my updated resume &amp; availability. And then today...nothing. No email reply. No phone call. You are a piece of meat to temp agencies. I got my hopes up for nothing. Feeling the sting.

Really bummed my @JeffreeStar halloween mystery box got cancelled somehow. Went from having a pending charge on my bank account to not having a charge at all. No communication about it either. :(
@CSGOEmpireV2 @sync1080p @_Sliced_ Yeah it's a learning curveball with this CS system but yh your system will improve but your customer service to high rollers won't improve and communication within your support team. When I worked for you for two years it was really disorganized, no communication between teams
@SKYserves Youre testing my patience again. There is still no internet as of this day! Location is not even on the list.
@NeedsAManDuh_ @_sabrinalana_ @lexitherealone @saul_rubio10 @RashidaZakiya @gabbshyphy @xberryhes @kyleeeeannn @itsthahope @keIseazy @LandonBagby @siimplyjayy Okay so.

@gram63 @BBCRadio3 *runs up and down boat hysterically at the thought of no internet...again*
@IndiGo6E our flight (Bombay to Delhi) has been delayed. No communication and heads up given to us about this.
@_woollyback @RokoshME @united_roll @Lumberist So although I see the need to reduce, I also see that we are improving. If you want to help so desperately you might want to look at what you can do, no internet, no phone, no fridge, no runners, no synthetic fibres,canoes, bikes, trains, cars etc! We still need to live
This guy just cut in front of me w no signal and then proceeded to go UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT WHY
no phone really got me out here communicating with people on this old ass pc.....oh man 😂
Things I like and dislike about Night Shift Like :Less people to deal with No Managment Dislike :Little to no communication with coworkers and boss. Little to no resources.
@virginmedia  absolute disgraceful service and appalled for any customer. No internet since 7am, 3 phone calls later in excess of 40mins waiting and the resolution is a new hub to be delivered. Shock can’t get it until Tuesday. Looks like SKY @skytv_ is going to get my custom
@kohiyote when the day comes where I need to look at furry porn in a Target with no phone data, I'll remember your brave words
@SMARTYMobileUK @ThreeUK so I had no signal from 2am Thursday morning till 8pm Thursday night and I’ve had one bar and 3G since. Paying for something that doesn’t work 🤦🏼‍♂️ https://t.co/rXhrkjOy5z
@paul_winginit You can’t get a signal because of the train or because no signal even exists outside of the train ?
@_thedrrew Live the life! No phone, just a couple mfs living in the moment 😂
Put my order in for fibre broadband with @VodafoneUK nearly 6 weeks ago! Was meant to go live today (for the third time) but surprise surprise... still no internet. Steer clear. #fibre #broadband #internet
The higher education system in the UK is a joke. No support, no communication, completely elitist. I want to learn and grow and go on to be qualified for my dream job but it seems like an impossible task unless I suddenly win thousands on the lottery🤷🏻‍♀️
@dhh I stumbled on them while searching for a sketchy guy I knew 20 years ago who has no Internet presence but apparently a couple of DUIs.I paid them $1 for the 7-day trial membership and canceled it right away as it seems they won't actually provide the extra info they promise.

Before the communication shutdown, things were looking up for young Kashmiri entrepreneurs. Now, with funds drying up and no internet, more than 100 startups in the valley have had to put the brakes on their dreams. https://t.co/AvAEqTAN5P
@NippySweetyLass Yeah, but there's no Internet in woods and therefore, no Twitter for him to throw around his wisdom...
There should be no phones so you don't bitch why there is no faculty in your deptt. There should be no phone so you wouldn't shoot what ABVP does in your campuses. There shouldn't be phone so you don't post your grievances with SSC on twitter. There shouldn't be phone at all.
@Walmart @Apple to the labs or hire labs to find the problem or better yet constantly check whether their are loop holes were china or usa ir havkers can penetrate it also when power went out in northern cali i found i had no wifi no phone no lights how will thst work

@phattuck @drawandstrike @drawandstrike jinxed it. No phone book, no action.
So we’re $100 out right now, and have had to deal with no internet, a rude @BestBuy employee, false claims on @NETGEAR s website, and just pure frustration. This week has already been so emotionally draining and we really didn’t deserve to have to go through this.
@VirginMediaIE No internet access on my WiFi (again) and your customer care line is constantly engaged. Explanation please?

No communication, no updates, and then no help with flights the next day. Cant see how they didn't see the crew issue potentially being a problem - could have allowed passengers to make other arrangements earlier. Pretty dreadful 2/2.

@robreiner @jenelr I totally agree. On a less serious note, I could hear Archie saying “They don’t impeach a president over no phone call Meathead.” Carroll O’Connor is gone on but I can tell you AllIn The Family was the greatest show of all time. No one could play Archie like Carroll O’Connor.
@ATTHelp my technician has not showed up to my scheduled appointment with no phone call. Glad i took off work...

3. Morning routine. Wake up, meditate, cold shower, no phone usage, journal &amp; hit the gym.
Interesting how things come to a halt when the internet is down. Heard someone crashed into a major wiring hub and they don't know when it'll be fixed. No internet in an entire city. Fun times.
@johnsolomonbain @ToryAmerican @QueenSeraphine I lived a good part of my childhood in a farm back in Ukraine. Life was hard as hell for my grand parents who lived there, especially during the winter.

I Honestly Need A Break From Reality and everyone ... I’m talking bout no phone no nothing
@theingthing In this instance, as the customer is on the edge of that cell, network service deteriorates and can result in intermittent service. Naturally, if both the primary and neighboring secondary cells are powerless, there is no signal at all.

@VodafoneUK what happens when you guarantee a date for broadband connection and fail to deliver? Asking on behalf of a family member who’s been waiting over 5 weeks now. Is your ‘guarantee’ meaningless? And no they can’t message you personally because they have no internet!
@OpenreachHelp 3 weeks and counting of no internet at our new address. How hard can it be to get an ENGINEER TO SHOW UP. They say moving house is one of the most stressful things you do in a lifetime, well you have added to that ten times over. Thanks, truly.

@ABC7Chicago Rescanned on my TiVo Roamio OTA this morning.  Problem is that the TiVo now has two Guide entries for ABC7; one (WLSHD) connects to the new broadcast signal but all Guide entries are "To be announced"; the other (WLSDT) shows the proper programming but has no signal.
@revuwution i see!!! i was kinda a joke when i started. was 9, libraries had no internet, learnt BASIC from a 15 year old book,
@Trutherbotanyo2 I certainly am. All day bike rides with no phone, no fear of 'what if...'; not being constantly bugged by worried parent: 'Where are you? What time you coming back?' No addiction to sharing your every move with your 'followers' on social media. Just out and enjoying the day.
U meet someone. You 2 get close. It’s all great for a while. Then someone stops trying. Talk less. Awkward conv. The drifting. No communication whatsoever. Memories start 2 fade. Then that person u know becomes the person u KNEW. That’s how is usually goes, right? Sad isn’t it.
Guys I know how to fix the 3 no signal !You just turn/switch your phone off then switch it back on again! This worked for me and I tried it with my mum so I think it fight work for other people!
@LizSpeidel @AncientLitDude Times havd changed drastically and not for the better. When I was in my twenties (Lincoln was in office!), there was no internet, cell phones or SM:) if a guy wanted to get in your pants, he had to impress you. If they still do, they still do for me! 😉Stand your ground!

@ThreeUK So I have service back after going to/from airplane mode, but no WiFi calling. I've seen no official mention from @ThreeUK of issues remaining. Is that a known issue? I get no signal at home or work so WiFi calling is essential to me
No phone call. It’s okay we only like Chips Ahoy Chewy here anyways 🖕🏿
@Cricketnation Your rep said that I had no signal anywhere because a tower was down. A week later with no signal still I called your tech support. There were no towers down. Your rep lied. I don't trust your company at all.
@virginmedia That link seems to be broken. I entered my postcode and it says no known issues. But I have no internet and when I called Virgin the automated service says there is a fault and the lady said it will last till the 24th.

@duallyyyy They didn’t just hold them. They kept it on both sides with people having zero recourse. Closing accounts with no communication. The countless scams they turn a blind eye to. The fees are higher no longer competitive. They just haven’t innovated, deciding to milk the customers.
@WOWCare No internet yet again... What's going on with your service in Clearwater, FL?
How did @SadiqKhan ever get in the position he’s in? He is an odious arrogant little man with no communication skills and no ability. Astounding. https://t.co/GrMAKJJ2go

@RajendraTiwari7 @listenshahid Its obvious he will be unable to send, as there is no Internet in Kashmir. Wouldn't i breach a privacy cover by asking a password of Email?
@wojo4hitz @teganandsara Ik ik I think this no phone rule focuses more on the artist’s perception of the audience instead of the audience’s perception of the artist, like a mechanism to have a more intimate show. It kinda sucks for people like me who can’t go but I respect it though
@CityPowerJhb @PowerJhb @EskomFoundation @CityofJoburgZA Coming on 25 hours with no power in Highlands North. No communication received about when we can expect power back, no updates. Please advise!

@cholweshabukali What is happening in Zambia? No internet #GiveZambiaInternet 😂 https://t.co/geqREUNMzx
@ground_guru @Jimmy_shan78 @MyFootballCoach I think the problem is that some coaches dont understand that there is no communication or decision making in unopposed training, the exercise you do after it is key to adding in those components

what is Nomophobia?-the fear of being without your mobile phone
@yoggytree @C0MACR0W @spiderfrog93 @JanPritt @HPE You do realize that unless you're an actual hermit who grows their own food and has no internet, living in the country is actually more detrimental to the environment right?
I love going to @UofLFootball games however my only complaint is there is no phone service inside the stadium. @vincetyra can we get some boosters inside the stadium? #GoCards
@XavsFutbol It's about the strategy, Zidane has been playing with the same " Crossing " technique for ages now, it's clearly not working now and he is still stuck on it, the team had no communication just bad performance
@KantosKetchum I speak overpowered mother"Go to your room. No internet for a week."
@KarenCivil @Kehlani Producer @EricGgg recalled Mac freestyling the first half of “2009”: “He did the first whole half of the song in a pitch-black booth with no phone or anything. I don’t even know how he did it, and for it to be so meaningful.” https://t.co/ASpHmfEg3U
@jeremyarroyo @Yankees I remember my dad at the time, with no internet to fact-check, would mess with me by telling me the Yankees were going to trade him because he refused to get a haircut.This wasn't true... was it?As a sidebar... my mom was disgustingly in love with Dennis Eckersley.
You can be in the middle of civilization and you’d still have no signal with sprint. Worst provider I swear 🤦🏻‍♂️
@SkyHelpTeam Last week it went off because ‘no signal’ and the same thing has happened again tonight. A team of people couldn’t help when we rang, all they could do was ask us to pay more money on top of the £83 a month we currently pay,for something that is not working!
I’m really out here with no phone case just raw dogging it
@PlayStation No internet connection
@magneteach @sirDukeDevin Two Hundred and more years ago, with no e-mail, no TV and no internet, the Electoral College made a lot of sense, but today it makes no sense atall!
@Ryanair I understand we can't avoid the extremities of nature somethings. But the complete lack of organisation, no communication, and the fact 44 people were left stranded outside the airport waiting for a bus for 3 hours... Including 2 newborns. That's ridiculous and not OK!
Wow havent been on twitter no phone what did i miss
@sprintcare Over 2 hours and still no phone, what ...a...joke 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 https://t.co/BExAACKwsh
@ATT sure would be nice if you guys did what you say you would do. This in now twice I have schedule to have service turned on at my place and no one has shown up. No tech. No phone. No show and still NO SERVICE! Very frustrating.

@BestBuySupport My laptop is being sent to a service repair center which I found out by email and no phone call to update me on this before hand. I call the store only to be answered, transferred and hung up on, to then be asked for survey on my satisfaction. Are you serious?
@zuninja754 @PlayApex @EAHelp Wow. It is listed in literally every other place except for origin. I haven’t even wanted to play this game because of this. No communication and then finally I’m told just wait for it, eventually it might work out?! Not ok @EAHelp   Not ok.
@AmazonHelp @amazonIN @amazonhelp I rcvd emails that delivery was attempted when there was no phone call/message rcvd. This is falsified communication which can go against the company. You're open to cross validate with your internal comms systems

@IndiGo6E you have made a mockery out of your passenger. Because of your on ground crew. Me &amp; My colleague gets to not board the flight 6E-185 even after checking in 3hrs prior. due to lag of no communication between your on ground crew. #worstairlines #indigoairlines #airport

@sonicmeerkat Lol what are you a caveman? Get into the 21st Century grandad!Wait... my phone charge is dying... no phone, stay with me - I must continue Tweeting and get home bef
@NitrateVille I looked into this. No internet here but Comcast, cutting to just internet and adding a streaming tv service is roughly the same price as keeping the service I have, and the cloud DVR services on streaming are extremely limited
No internet connection here on campus so the Moroccan midget, Fatwhale, Monkeyass &amp; Military perps are on the run with their subs getting spots and creating hyperlinks in order to shoot EMF at me which they tried twice at this very moment 150 degrees hitting my right ankle... https://t.co/kbCdT8ZLPF

INJUSTICE: I've seen racism first hand &amp; today was my 2nd #DrivingWhileBlack for "running 🛑" &amp; "no signal" 🤷‍♀️ BS it was 2 black men that's why. They "smelled drugs". Cuffed them, had me sit in back of car. Found 0️⃣. Was I ok? Why? Because w/ Black Men? 🖕🐷Just sad and angry.
@TwinTemple Exactly! Unfortunately, the key words are intellect and knowledge. There was a time we had to seek this information out. There was no internet. Always breaking down and exploring. It pleases me to do it respectfully. Love you guys! Ave! 😈
@belindagrant80 Sorry Belinda, not today. But I'm here having my coffee now, and then I have to go and pack for a few days away with my parents. No internet access, poor mobile phone coverage, so probably no Twitter. But I'll be with you all in spirit.
SO IM PHONELESS
@KensingtonRoyal Please visit Indian Occupied Kashmir, the state has been sieged by Indian forces, it is a desperate humaitarian situation. 72 years of occupation and since 5th Aug the Kashmiris have no communication, no medical supplies and are being tortured.

@softhiin This person really needs help... and no internet connection..

@JoeUrquhartYEP Just a shame LUTV messed up and didn't work so we missed seeing this, all other celebrations, and lost importantly, the game. Still no communication from the club about it, loads of pissed off fans @andrearadri @LUFC , no word on refunds. @GrahamSmyth @LeedsNews

@MissAshes92 Glad to hear there is a gate. I haven't passed there in a while. This is a good site for a camera, compared to radar/laser gauges. Agree, underwater gauges are more susceptible to water and debris damage, and thus a false or no signal. You can tie that in to ATX.Floods.
@xSoulHunterDKx @DayZ @NakedByo For them to make it this far. Without the people who purchased the game, they wouldn't be where they are. It's a great game, incredible in my own opinion. But for about a week, it's been in a broken state, with no communication on the situation. Only a sales pitch. Not cool.

@snsachinnandu @oyorooms I had the same experience. Booked hotel with OYO at Haridwar and Gangotri for my parents. After reaching there, they came to know that those hotels have discontinued their relationship with OYO. There was no communication to us.
the only people more annoying than exols are 2nd generation stans bc in their time there was no internet so they were fighting physically and writing their drags down in notebooks and now we all suffering from 20th century jokes

@TheCriminalRose It had been months indeed, and unfortunately for them, things hadn't ended in the best of ways.Actually, they hadn't even ended.There was no closure, no communication.He didn't know where Neo had gone to,And he truly didn't want to know anyway. +

@Asameow17 @HeyRhett @kaye_el_bie @kissdeo02 Fans muna.. no phone for ML lol
@BSNLCorporate I guess bsnl is purposefully shutting down the internet in Karnataka, Bangalore, vijayanagar, if I call the customer service they ask me me call some other time, no use complaining in the exchange near me. They didn't resolve my prob. No internet from a week ..
@ladyrelodsalot @elgatogaming It’s not just in OBS though, it was saying no signal, now it’s just a black screen. In OBS and the elgato game capture app.

@AirtelNigeria despite full network signal on my phone, the recently purchased mifi has no internet access barely 2 wks after recharging. The same problem encountered soon after purchase of the mifi. Any solution to this? Many thanks.
@scottros @margaretomara What a great piece! Thanks for sharing. You put your finger on the tensions that most observers weren't thinking about for another 20 years. As for §230, we don't need to excuse misconduct to reverse the Stratton decision. The safe harbor is overbroad.https://t.co/dfw0tln3tK
@amy_tisi Strange that there was no signal eh?
I'm home now It was fun and all but it's good to be back I had no internet there too --"But hey I'm here,I'm safe

@Hermesparcels have waited in all day for a parcel that was to be delivered between 8am and 6pm and at 8pm nothing had arrived and there has been no communication. This is appalling customer service.
T-mobile boasts having 650 shops. But company is compromised by the lack of service on weekends! They offer a solution to problem - no signal , in 3 days. Big company shit and lack of competence of the Board. In communication services 8 hours is eternity and a complete disaster !
@LucySetonW Just got out of hot bath and have glass of wine. I’ll post some pics later. Had almost no signal most of the day, and got drenched and dazzled so pics not great. We will be doing this again, I’m sure. Xx
@LaurenGermanArg @JaneHil52691644 Hahahahaha !!!You're crazy!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻However, I'm at my parents, in the middle of the countryside, it's so lost that we have almost no internet signal, it is a torture to read your tweets, I think I will have to leave...

@BarbKaplitz @HeatherLinda11 @SparlingAngela Our experience is changes on pain medication and other stigmatized medications often no communication despite no reason.
@iGoBiTima @ATTHelp @ATT @GetSpectrum Probably. Our phone is connected to our internet. So no internet, no house phone. For months we would have times where we wouldn’t have service. It would start with outages for 30 minutes at a time up to the point it would be hours. Just tired of dealing with them.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Yeah. It’s in the basement with a secret door, and has no internet. https://t.co/GMYs8Q02Xh
@virginmedia is there an ongoing issue with broadband in the BD16 area? I’ve had numerous instances of no internet connection over the last week. Your app says that all’s fine with your service, your telephone message disagrees and says there’s an issue...any idea what’s going on
@karlmondon I remember that game well.  Washington was playing.  Back then, no internet, no big weather reports at your fingertips and no clue that wind was coming in the next day.
@Steph73_NL It's possible if it was trying to download an update to the walk that it was stuck waiting in an "I'm still downloading" state with no internet and not visible in my walks because of that.   If it's still not in My Walks, try re-running the app and doing "restore purchases".
@bt_uk I've gone 3 weeks with no internet and was really looking forward to having it again! It's like living in a cave!
@NickHunt7 i cant even do it. no internet😭😭😭😭
24hr no internet connection, enough

I remember when opening the browser icon on the phone was a big no no. Now if there is no internet for like a minute my phone is an idiot box https://t.co/rleoRQJ5io
Ladies, why do y’all send random pics out the blue after months of no communication.

Thought I was finna die wit no phone
@virginmedia Tried this but it doesn't do anything because there's no internet. Worse still just got back from a 13hr round trip to Liverpool traveling on a virgin train connected to virgin WiFi supplied by the train and couldn't connect with either 4g or WiFi

No phone or nothing like I just want peace
This generation has no communication skills... shit crazy 😂
@Steph73_NL Quite a lot of the routes have places with no internet at all so the app needs to work in no internet conditions.  All it needs is GPS (to be able to see the sky) during the walk.
@DakHarding We're in our rooms with no internet...
@Zuku_WeCare please fix account 871267 no Internet

@iwalkc I had my phone crash on me yesterday mid walk. I had no internet connection, so couldn’t reload my walk (no worries, I didn’t get lost). Is there a way to download my walks as a back up? Love your walks and the app!
@YeroTunder Yeah, when there's no internet around and I'm bored as hell 😆
Hate having no internet
And this is why it’ll never work 🤷🏾‍♀️ no communication
Woke up and only 2 notifications? Very disappointed in you people. Go to your rooms. No internet.
@BeSpleen @PamAinsley @kurteichenwald The difference from 1933 to 45 was, that these people were brainwashed by propaganda, there was no internet, no free press and hardly anyone travelled abroad. They believed the Nazi bullshit. Whoever believes the Trump lies and scaremongering is an idiot, a dangerous one, too !

@DrBeniRusani I don't know but we practice this. When we're going out together, no phone.. I mean, we still can take pictures or anything, but we use to talk, or staring at each other rather than playing with phone..
@MilaKunisNow Mila, return my call. Meaning actually pick the phone up and press on the key pad and dial my number so we can actually have conversation. We have been communicating for almost a year now. Still....no phone call! 1347-792-8575 ericaquino411@gmail.com. call meeeeee or email me.
There was no signal on the #PeoplesVoteMarch today. We made it to Parliament Sq due to some crafty shortcuts and heard the result of the #Letwin vote live. The roar from the crowd was awesome!

Stunningly rubbish customer service from @madebygoogle  @GoogleUK @google. No phone, no refund and 'compensation' offer worse than discount I used with original order.

@sweetmark2801 @nickjonas @priyankachopra Omg wow, it's so adorable to live in a militarized zone where there's no phone and internet access and ppl are routinely raped and murdered 😍
@VodafoneUK No phone call unfortunately. I'll PM you in case you can help.
Well, it seems another day of no Internet and no indication of how long this problem will last... @virginmedia, communication is important to customers in these times, I just wish I knew what was going on. Your website says no errors but the phone lines says engineers are on it.
The family's talking about christmas.. someone fucking save me from being stuck in the middle of the annual family Christmas arguments in someone else's house with no internet and no easy way to fuck off back home
@hjcampbell26 Except in HC there is often not another ''bakery'' depending on insurance and physical location. Also regardless businesses should have to give equal service to everyone. Otherwise we get all sorts of discrimination. Conservative? No internet for you. Trans? No HC for you etc.

Even now the order hasn't been delivered which was placed on 21:58. No communication from the delivery guy's end! And the outlet says that it is trying to reach him and inform asap!
No communication by the #njdevils. So many lost pucks and battles because they don’t talk and get caught in no mans land. Look so disorganized.
In my ten plus years of using @ATT I've never been so disappointed in their customer service. No internet for six days. No help. No solutions. Looking to @verizon or @GetSpectrum for proper service if either is interested in a new customer.
Day 2 of no internet Still fuckin bored
@ACTFibernet In the evening, I called your customer care where (AGAIN!!!) I was given a false assurance that it will be fixed in sometime but there’s still no internet. Your services are pathetic &amp; stop lying and giving false assurance
@GaylyDreadful No, because I'm stuck in the studio all weekend with no internet 😭😭😭
Y’all I literally woke up at 7:30 and literally walked to I could t walk anymore. Lately myself has been so off of my normal life and routine that I’ve been so nervous. Today walking 7 miles I think I found clarity. No phone, music, distractions. Just me and Mother Nature 💕

@ThePublius2020 I personally would like to hope he doesn't get really sick and have a stroke and have to poop in a bag that he has to wheel around with him and cannot talk and gets stuck in a nursing home with MSNBC 24 hours a day and no internet or way to tweet. That'd be very terrible for him.
@darling_sammy Instead of the phantom vibration in pants pocket sensation, a phantom fleshy hand caressing you from inside your pocket
It's not that I love Android, because I don't. It's just that I don't like iOS. I tried the Ubuntuphone, but as soon I booted the thing for the first time, I saw the complete failure of it. So I went back to Android. It's either that or no phone at all. https://t.co/8WHHgsqzni

Great weekend with no internet, it's not like I had a whole bunch of stuff to do anyway :' )
@Sidjohnsonnn It depends on when and where, but keep in mind there is zero support on for google fi issues. They will make you reboot your phone, buy new sim card before an "escalation" that takes 24-72hrs for response. That is a long time with no phone number.
Hi @TfL Not sure what’s happened to the underground WiFi, but my phone used to connect quickly and automatically. Now it rarely connects, and if it does, it takes a good couple of minutes. I can get on to the WiFi, but there’s no internet connection. Please help!

@virginmedia No, she couldn’t tell us when it started or when it was going to be fixed. Just that it was due to an upgrade in the area and to call back in two days if we had no internet. And said we could see the outage details on our account page. Which we can’t :(

Hey @cashapp ,How much money do you really save by not investing time and resources into @CashSupport ?No phone line? 48 hour email responses?Increase the transaction cost if you have to, this lack of support is a huge turnoff.

My favourite thing to do at the moment is go out with no phone like I used to, back in 1995, cos the phones were huge and cost $2 a minute to call people. Or if I do, make sure it's only at 10% power so I only use it in an emergency.
@Scala9111 That was two hours ago. No internet lol. We just landed! Thanks!❤⚘

@JioCare see this. We love Jio. Jio has revolutionized the telecom sectors, we should admit this. But still, I believe in Jio that's why I haven't ported my sim to other telecom.

Having no internet connection and to joke about it as a 1st world problem really bites you in the ass when you are at the receiving end of that joke. My entitled-self is internally screaming, no doubt.
If you are using paraffin for heating it is more likely that you have no internet access
@OpenreachHelp Hi Openreach attended my home on Wednesday to connect phonline/internet, was unable to connect due to external fault. An Openreach engineer was booked via EE for yesterday to connect my internet/phone line in N22 8DN. Today, I STILL have no internet/phonline.

@ThePublius2020 Trump doesn't need any books. He gets a television with two stations: Fox and RT. The internet with access to only Twitter. We want to be able to read about his brilliant thoughts.  No phone. A nine hole golf course with boulders strewn about and day old fast food and Moxie.

@IndiGo6E you have made a mockery out of your passenger. Because of your on ground crew. Me &amp; My colleague gets to not board the flight 6E-185 even after checking in 3hrs prior. due to lag of no communication between your on ground crew. #worstairlines #indigoairlines #airport
@sektor it gives us signal, if theres no cable then we can’t watch bc no signal KEKW

Sitting in a parking lot waiting to see hot air balloons and I have little to no signal...
@iWilliiam @BenGeskin @91mobiles No phone yet has a smaller hole than the Note 10. And S11 will be even smaller.
Third grade level! For a career politician, Nancy has "NO" communication skills in a room full of men &amp; "REAL" agenda.  Pelosi has a history of walking out of important meetings when she isn't happy...FAILED LEADERSHIP!Sh*t on S.F. sidewalks speaks volumes for Pelosi policy. https://t.co/IpBkhJRgZc
@AMDGaming i assume theres no internet so ill settle for a singleplayer game like wolfenstein

@jaffathecake @dassurma I'm using Share Target (v2) in an app that is enabled for offline. Launching the app from the home screen fully works in airplane mode, but sharing to it fails due to no internet. Is this really broken or am I doing it wrong? https://t.co/5tQ3auI0u1

@ChoeNut This person pretended to care when I was at my lowest &amp; once I got boring, she said it wasn't fun anymore &amp; she ended  the friendship. Via text, no phone call or anything. This was a life lesson to help me recognize future frauds.
@sonicmeerkat Lol what are you a caveman? Get into the 21st Century grandad!Wait... my phone charge is dying... no phone, stay with me - I must continue Tweeting and get home bef
@NitrateVille I looked into this. No internet here but Comcast, cutting to just internet and adding a streaming tv service is roughly the same price as keeping the service I have, and the cloud DVR services on streaming are extremely limited
No internet connection here on campus so the Moroccan midget, Fatwhale, Monkeyass &amp; Military perps are on the run with their subs getting spots and creating hyperlinks in order to shoot EMF at me which they tried twice at this very moment 150 degrees hitting my right ankle... https://t.co/kbCdT8ZLPF
@joswinson There was no signal to send the email in the ditch. Carrier pigeon only. It'll arrive in the EU in the next few weeks.

INJUSTICE: I've seen racism first hand &amp; today was my 2nd #DrivingWhileBlack for "running 🛑" &amp; "no signal" 🤷‍♀️ BS it was 2 black men that's why. They "smelled drugs". Cuffed them, had me sit in back of car. Found 0️⃣. Was I ok? Why? Because w/ Black Men? 🖕🐷Just sad and angry.
@TwinTemple Exactly! Unfortunately, the key words are intellect and knowledge. There was a time we had to seek this information out. There was no internet. Always breaking down and exploring. It pleases me to do it respectfully. Love you guys! Ave! 😈
@belindagrant80 Sorry Belinda, not today. But I'm here having my coffee now, and then I have to go and pack for a few days away with my parents. No internet access, poor mobile phone coverage, so probably no Twitter. But I'll be with you all in spirit.
SO IM PHONELESS
@KensingtonRoyal Please visit Indian Occupied Kashmir, the state has been sieged by Indian forces, it is a desperate humaitarian situation. 72 years of occupation and since 5th Aug the Kashmiris have no communication, no medical supplies and are being tortured.
@ThreeUK I want to leave your network. No signal or just shitty in general...at times when I most needed it and your customer service is even worse!!!!!!!!
@josayye1 @gvbbylvls @Kkaylahernandex Having a good time no phone in sight, photographic memory more liek
@BrynLaw @ben_parker19 @LUFC @andrearadri @leedsunitedtv @JayMooney86 What's happening about everyone who paid for LUTV today but got no stream and no communication from the club? Nothing has been mentioned.

@VicVanquish Bruh you got a phone. Back in my day rehab meant no phone 😭
@softhiin This person really needs help... and no internet connection..
I woke up this morning in someone else’s shirt, my rings on the wrong finger, hair a mess and NO PHONE. I’m thinking “i lost my phone it’s probably in Mexico already” haha. I just wanna talk to the person who let me get drunk.. 🥴
@JoeUrquhartYEP Just a shame LUTV messed up and didn't work so we missed seeing this, all other celebrations, and lost importantly, the game. Still no communication from the club about it, loads of pissed off fans @andrearadri @LUFC , no word on refunds. @GrahamSmyth @LeedsNews
Did this last night at dinner after teaching. Only seat left at lovely bay-beside restaurant, Saltwater Fish, was corner barstool. Just sat...calmed out. No book, no writing, no phone.

@Flow no internet @cooperage for a week now
So uh about the video. My dad yeeted my phone and said no phone while on the hike so I didnt record anything.... Sorry gamers maybe next time smh
@emileighsrose Bands did a lot of stupid shit in the day to get noticed. There was no internet to beat them down for it. It was all about selling records, not downloads.

@Reuters I like this lady.   She is on the ball.  Not trying to bullshit the American people.  Freedom first.  No  communication with Area 51 .   Wacko’s

Aur mari ex ka connection Ptcl ke taraa ta connect taa but no internet  (no feelings for me) https://t.co/KAl2BMGVIf
@MissAshes92 Glad to hear there is a gate. I haven't passed there in a while. This is a good site for a camera, compared to radar/laser gauges. Agree, underwater gauges are more susceptible to water and debris damage, and thus a false or no signal. You can tie that in to ATX.Floods.
@xSoulHunterDKx @DayZ @NakedByo For them to make it this far. Without the people who purchased the game, they wouldn't be where they are. It's a great game, incredible in my own opinion. But for about a week, it's been in a broken state, with no communication on the situation. Only a sales pitch. Not cool.
@annakhachiyan Somewhere with no internet connection
I can't watch any streams!!😦 I literally have only 2gb of data left... Having no internet is hard!! I have to act like a human! https://t.co/lQ7vOK9MyG

Just thought up of a nice idea for a #Kenshi Halloween mod as part of the community discord event! Will work on it while my desktop has no Internet connection :)
@Asmali77 Kenyans jameni,question/answer and no communication
@snsachinnandu @oyorooms I had the same experience. Booked hotel with OYO at Haridwar and Gangotri for my parents. After reaching there, they came to know that those hotels have discontinued their relationship with OYO. There was no communication to us.
the only people more annoying than exols are 2nd generation stans bc in their time there was no internet so they were fighting physically and writing their drags down in notebooks and now we all suffering from 20th century jokes
chris you said you can be my boyfriend, well: BE MY BF AND LET ME SLEEP AT YOURS NEXT SATURDAY CAUSE MY BROTHER JUST KICKED ME OUT AND I HAVE TO GO TO MY GRANDPARENTS with no internet and other problematic stuff
@mrcollins_o No battery = no phone
@TheCriminalRose It had been months indeed, and unfortunately for them, things hadn't ended in the best of ways.Actually, they hadn't even ended.There was no closure, no communication.He didn't know where Neo had gone to,And he truly didn't want to know anyway. +
I'm working in a pop culture event and no signal of a Madeline/Badeline cosplay, i'm so disappointed
@Shizzle1124 @pulte Yeah i can see that...i honestly havent seen anyone who has won the money...i keep seeing these but never see videos of the winners..no phone calls SS or anything..so im leary of these
Was that a bout of nomophobia, @evolvingTLS? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a great idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #usecase
I went into a library today and saw a teenage boy reading a book on a sofa with some biscuits next to him. No phone. No headphones. Nothing but the book and his snacks. So pure ❤️

@Airtel_Presence Dear #BhartiAirtel the continues efforts to keep ur consumer n trouble doing successfully great."30 min of NO NETWORK 12.07 am to 12.37 am",Think of it bcoz I missed my booked cab due to no communication, and wasting my time at midnight in wait of morning for general transport
@TanTran__ @ATT dude..... i woke up devastated because i had no internet
How the fuck did I agree to this phoneless speakeasy bullshit DURING SATURDAY FOOTBALL?!?!?!?!?
@Asameow17 @HeyRhett @kaye_el_bie @kissdeo02 Fans muna.. no phone for ML lol
@BSNLCorporate I guess bsnl is purposefully shutting down the internet in Karnataka, Bangalore, vijayanagar, if I call the customer service they ask me me call some other time, no use complaining in the exchange near me. They didn't resolve my prob. No internet from a week ..
@ladyrelodsalot @elgatogaming It’s not just in OBS though, it was saying no signal, now it’s just a black screen. In OBS and the elgato game capture app.

@AirtelNigeria despite full network signal on my phone, the recently purchased mifi has no internet access barely 2 wks after recharging. The same problem encountered soon after purchase of the mifi. Any solution to this? Many thanks.
@scottros @margaretomara What a great piece! Thanks for sharing. You put your finger on the tensions that most observers weren't thinking about for another 20 years. As for §230, we don't need to excuse misconduct to reverse the Stratton decision. The safe harbor is overbroad.https://t.co/dfw0tln3tK
@amy_tisi Strange that there was no signal eh?
I'm home now It was fun and all but it's good to be back I had no internet there too --"But hey I'm here,I'm safe
Not no texting to make sure i was straight, no phone calls, i mean physically 🖤💯 that’s my dawg 4L
@Hermesparcels have waited in all day for a parcel that was to be delivered between 8am and 6pm and at 8pm nothing had arrived and there has been no communication. This is appalling customer service.
T-mobile boasts having 650 shops. But company is compromised by the lack of service on weekends! They offer a solution to problem - no signal , in 3 days. Big company shit and lack of competence of the Board. In communication services 8 hours is eternity and a complete disaster !
@LucySetonW Just got out of hot bath and have glass of wine. I’ll post some pics later. Had almost no signal most of the day, and got drenched and dazzled so pics not great. We will be doing this again, I’m sure. Xx
@LaurenGermanArg @JaneHil52691644 Hahahahaha !!!You're crazy!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻However, I'm at my parents, in the middle of the countryside, it's so lost that we have almost no internet signal, it is a torture to read your tweets, I think I will have to leave...

@BarbKaplitz @HeatherLinda11 @SparlingAngela Our experience is changes on pain medication and other stigmatized medications often no communication despite no reason.
@iGoBiTima @ATTHelp @ATT @GetSpectrum Probably. Our phone is connected to our internet. So no internet, no house phone. For months we would have times where we wouldn’t have service. It would start with outages for 30 minutes at a time up to the point it would be hours. Just tired of dealing with them.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Yeah. It’s in the basement with a secret door, and has no internet. https://t.co/GMYs8Q02Xh
@virginmedia is there an ongoing issue with broadband in the BD16 area? I’ve had numerous instances of no internet connection over the last week. Your app says that all’s fine with your service, your telephone message disagrees and says there’s an issue...any idea what’s going on
@karlmondon I remember that game well.  Washington was playing.  Back then, no internet, no big weather reports at your fingertips and no clue that wind was coming in the next day.
@Steph73_NL It's possible if it was trying to download an update to the walk that it was stuck waiting in an "I'm still downloading" state with no internet and not visible in my walks because of that.   If it's still not in My Walks, try re-running the app and doing "restore purchases".
@bt_uk I've gone 3 weeks with no internet and was really looking forward to having it again! It's like living in a cave!
@NickHunt7 i cant even do it. no internet😭😭😭😭
24hr no internet connection, enough
No internet till atleast Tuesday... Thanks @tmobile_webcare
It’s funny I saw her at the (kinda) beginning (Lungs era REPRESENT) and at the latest and to see her growth vocals and performance wise was so amazing to witness (sadly I don’t have any vids from the first concert cause I had no phone). okay I’m done rambling
I remember when opening the browser icon on the phone was a big no no. Now if there is no internet for like a minute my phone is an idiot box https://t.co/rleoRQJ5io
Ladies, why do y’all send random pics out the blue after months of no communication.

Thought I was finna die wit no phone
@virginmedia Tried this but it doesn't do anything because there's no internet. Worse still just got back from a 13hr round trip to Liverpool traveling on a virgin train connected to virgin WiFi supplied by the train and couldn't connect with either 4g or WiFi
@IyIaah Thought you had no internet
can we go to cafe and just drink coffee, no phone. you and me. talk eye to eye

Immediately you say "I Love you," .....she becomes cashless, phoneless, dataless, homeless, fatherless. All kinds of less!🤣🤣🤣
No phone or nothing like I just want peace
This generation has no communication skills... shit crazy 😂
@Steph73_NL Quite a lot of the routes have places with no internet at all so the app needs to work in no internet conditions.  All it needs is GPS (to be able to see the sky) during the walk.
@DakHarding We're in our rooms with no internet...
@Zuku_WeCare please fix account 871267 no Internet
@AnisTabet23 Only in Lebanon would the people be so disrespected to the point where after DAYS of protests, there’s no communication whatsoever from/about the president
@iwalkc I had my phone crash on me yesterday mid walk. I had no internet connection, so couldn’t reload my walk (no worries, I didn’t get lost). Is there a way to download my walks as a back up? Love your walks and the app!
@YeroTunder Yeah, when there's no internet around and I'm bored as hell 😆
Hate having no internet
And this is why it’ll never work 🤷🏾‍♀️ no communication
Woke up and only 2 notifications? Very disappointed in you people. Go to your rooms. No internet.
@BeSpleen @PamAinsley @kurteichenwald The difference from 1933 to 45 was, that these people were brainwashed by propaganda, there was no internet, no free press and hardly anyone travelled abroad. They believed the Nazi bullshit. Whoever believes the Trump lies and scaremongering is an idiot, a dangerous one, too !

@DrBeniRusani I don't know but we practice this. When we're going out together, no phone.. I mean, we still can take pictures or anything, but we use to talk, or staring at each other rather than playing with phone..
@MilaKunisNow Mila, return my call. Meaning actually pick the phone up and press on the key pad and dial my number so we can actually have conversation. We have been communicating for almost a year now. Still....no phone call! 1347-792-8575 ericaquino411@gmail.com. call meeeeee or email me.
There was no signal on the #PeoplesVoteMarch today. We made it to Parliament Sq due to some crafty shortcuts and heard the result of the #Letwin vote live. The roar from the crowd was awesome!

Stunningly rubbish customer service from @madebygoogle  @GoogleUK @google. No phone, no refund and 'compensation' offer worse than discount I used with original order.

@cherrylaneGC Hi, I booked 4 tickets for the Halloween event at Podington on evening of 30th October. I’ve seen on Facebook that this even was removed. Is it no longer taking place? I’ve had no communication regarding this and certainly no refund. Can you please advise??? Thanks
@sweetmark2801 @nickjonas @priyankachopra Omg wow, it's so adorable to live in a militarized zone where there's no phone and internet access and ppl are routinely raped and murdered 😍
@VodafoneUK No phone call unfortunately. I'll PM you in case you can help.
Well, it seems another day of no Internet and no indication of how long this problem will last... @virginmedia, communication is important to customers in these times, I just wish I knew what was going on. Your website says no errors but the phone lines says engineers are on it.
The family's talking about christmas.. someone fucking save me from being stuck in the middle of the annual family Christmas arguments in someone else's house with no internet and no easy way to fuck off back home
@hjcampbell26 Except in HC there is often not another ''bakery'' depending on insurance and physical location. Also regardless businesses should have to give equal service to everyone. Otherwise we get all sorts of discrimination. Conservative? No internet for you. Trans? No HC for you etc.

No communication by the #njdevils. So many lost pucks and battles because they don’t talk and get caught in no mans land. Look so disorganized.
In my ten plus years of using @ATT I've never been so disappointed in their customer service. No internet for six days. No help. No solutions. Looking to @verizon or @GetSpectrum for proper service if either is interested in a new customer.
Day 2 of no internet Still fuckin bored
@ACTFibernet In the evening, I called your customer care where (AGAIN!!!) I was given a false assurance that it will be fixed in sometime but there’s still no internet. Your services are pathetic &amp; stop lying and giving false assurance
@GaylyDreadful No, because I'm stuck in the studio all weekend with no internet 😭😭😭
Y’all I literally woke up at 7:30 and literally walked to I could t walk anymore. Lately myself has been so off of my normal life and routine that I’ve been so nervous. Today walking 7 miles I think I found clarity. No phone, music, distractions. Just me and Mother Nature 💕

@darling_sammy Instead of the phantom vibration in pants pocket sensation, a phantom fleshy hand caressing you from inside your pocket
It's not that I love Android, because I don't. It's just that I don't like iOS. I tried the Ubuntuphone, but as soon I booted the thing for the first time, I saw the complete failure of it. So I went back to Android. It's either that or no phone at all. https://t.co/8WHHgsqzni

@Sidjohnsonnn It depends on when and where, but keep in mind there is zero support on for google fi issues. They will make you reboot your phone, buy new sim card before an "escalation" that takes 24-72hrs for response. That is a long time with no phone number.
Hi @TfL Not sure what’s happened to the underground WiFi, but my phone used to connect quickly and automatically. Now it rarely connects, and if it does, it takes a good couple of minutes. I can get on to the WiFi, but there’s no internet connection. Please help!

@Stillberto One of the most frustrating things about the way VAR is currently used is that there is no communication of the reasoning behind decisions. I would love to hear the conversation between the officials that resulted in that penalty not being given.

I saw a guy at Starbucks today.No tablet.No laptop.No phone. No lights. No motor cars.Not a single luxury. He just sat there.Drinking coconut water.Like a Robinson Crusoe, as primitive as can be.
4/... All this really helped..... And then I decided I needed a longer term vision. A plan... ... ... So I went to the Job Centre (in Rawtenstall) and I began looking through the careers book (a huge book). We had no internet then, remember!? Anyway, I stumbled across...

@DaveVescio @BrandonJRouth @StephenAmell  That reminds me of this: “No phone, no lights, no motor carnot a single luxurylike Robinson Crusoe,it's primitive as can be.” 🤣🤣🤣
My favourite thing to do at the moment is go out with no phone like I used to, back in 1995, cos the phones were huge and cost $2 a minute to call people. Or if I do, make sure it's only at 10% power so I only use it in an emergency.
@Scala9111 That was two hours ago. No internet lol. We just landed! Thanks!❤⚘

@ThePublius2020 Trump doesn't need any books. He gets a television with two stations: Fox and RT. The internet with access to only Twitter. We want to be able to read about his brilliant thoughts.  No phone. A nine hole golf course with boulders strewn about and day old fast food and Moxie.

@plusnethelp no internet again today. Called your helpline &amp; have an engineer coming out (for the third time) to fix it on Monday. I’m not confident. Don’t use plusnet for your ISP lads. Turns out they *do* let you down. Constantly.
@selfstyledsiren Growing up in the 70s, Judge Crater was a pretty common reference, but there was no internet and I never knew what the hell it meant.

I love @ThreeUK, but the recent outside has been handled terribly. No communication for something like 6 hours of the outage. Today we get an email saying "Sorry, if you want to know your options call us". Just say sorry and refund everyone 1 day line usage. https://t.co/qxGB33hsGl

No chat  x no communication. 👍
@Chico3DSquirrel I am absolutely devastated.  I have had to say goodbye to my iPhone   That is why I did not come back on last night.  Something had gone wrong in the connection of the phone for charging. Problem with iphones they cost so mu;ch to get mended.  I had no phone
@BanKsEsports most importantly there was no internet to spoil the whole thing
@cbschicago I really wish you would address the issue on why #CBS #CBS2Chicago is the hardest channel in Chicago to pick up with an antenna. I had finally found a antenna position to get #CBS then we had to rescan all channels. Now the channel name shows up but still no signal.

@KeithMillsD7 @Donnachain22 there is a conscious, deliberate &amp; sinister policy to sneak in hundreds of so-called 'asylum seekers' under dead of night into small villages around Ireland! No consultation, no communication, no choice!
The recent mess at @ThreeUK finally pushed me to move to a different carrier. Months of no internet in town centerMonths of adult filter blocking things even though it's offDozens of times on the phone with supportLasw few days were even worse. Bye @ThreeUK Hello @PlusNet
@SKYserves we have no internet connection today. Please check

@sextoyspolitics I just went upstairs to watch it, it got like 30 seconds in and now it's stuck on an infinite load. Sometimes the internet here just doesn't work right. It's totally rediculous but it's this or no internet.

@SkyUK Months with intermittent broadband connection. 4 engineers. Hours and hours of phone calls. 22 different people telling me it will be fixed. And guess what. I wake up this morning and still no internet. Sky you are a joke. Equipment is going in the bin.

Hopeless customer service @asianetcabletv after upgrading to your digital TV I am suffering from bad picture quality, no signal issues everyday. Why am I paying you anything...last 3 days no cable even after making 10 to 30 calls to your customer service.
@ThreeUK so got up this morning and had WiFi calling in my house - took phone with me outside and came back to ‘no service’. Phone is useless without it as no signal in our village - please get it sorted!  Done all usual fixes ....

@MJairosi No signal is needed to be given to start the rebellion. Spontaneous reactions from people all over Zimbabwe will do. If you organise a date and place the junta will counter and put security or even ban. That's the reason why at any hint of protest police are thrown in the roads
@bt_uk Hi Paula, the pic shows what I should be getting (100m download and 10m upload minimum) My internet keeps dropping with no internet for hours at a time. Last night I had no internet for 6 hours.

@ThreeUK Please help me out here, my phone still has no signal despite turning it off and on countless times. I've even traveled from the I.O.W to Surrey with still no sign of any signal. To add to this, my three phone number was meant to be transferred from my old three sim
@DXdelivery for 3 days I’ve had my delivery booked in and promised within certain time and each has failed no communication. I have to collect from you today as I’ve stressed multiple times I need it this weekend. Shocking service!

@nobucchika THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ME AND KEN ARE LEFT W NO INTERNET DURING THE DAY WE BECOME ACTUAL ANIMALS
@selfawaresoup @la_mafaldita Ever travelled from Munic into Austria? By train (DB...😭)? There is virually NO internet reception before crossing the Austrian border, except when finally reaching some town. But, as soon as in Austria, zack, 4G (to be fair, nothing in the tunnels on the Austrian side).
@DoT_India It's possible to Get UPC CODE for my old AIRCEL Number But unfortunately there is no signal is displaying but I need that number

@shaunamkinney I used an online retailer from that area, and it took a week for my order to be dispatched. Almost no communication from them.Never again. shaking my fist ;-)
@iamanandd @naukarshah You are diverting the issue by taking it to a personal plain. Even if my mobile phone remains blocked, I shall not be silenced. Read the history of our freedom struggle? There was no phone, yet people protested. You people are indirectly helping two-nation theorists.

Wow @VodafoneGhana my broadband stopped working last night (second time this week)  and I was forced to sleep. I wake up and still no internet? Please give me back my internet, I paid for It.
@VOXI_UK thanks for screwing up my order! Despite my following instructions, you have transferred my old number to a sim that I don’t have 😡🤷‍♀️ and now refuse to transfer it to the Actual Sim that You Sent Me. WTF?? I am now meant to have no phone service for 3 days??

@Dorns84 Just staring at the side of your bonce. No communication 😂😂😂 final whistle goes “right, how is everyone?”
@IndiaPostOffice Went to post office yesterday. But as has been the case, no internet banking for my existing account. Thrice it has happened now, and twice after you have had given clear Instructions.
@colettebrowne People in communities have concerns, some of them legitimate, some of them based on ignorance, some of them abhorrently racist. Common theme seems to be a vacuum of planning and no communication plans or integration investment/plans from government. This needs to improve
@SafaricomPLC  why no internet access?

@DevilishDanni @instagram Well it's early days I suppose but no sign of anything just yet, wouldn't surprise me if no communication. I've emailed them, contacted them on here and Instagram itself. Time will tell
No electricity, no water, no internet  the whole day yesterday.  It gave me an opportunity to spend time with my family, they are actually very good and nice  people 🤩🤩#Zambia#LoadShedding
Succeed with no instagram for 2 weeks and now i was thinking to get this nokia phone so that i’m away from this socmed/smartphone thingy. But, sometime i was thinking its better to have no phone at all. #JustSaying https://t.co/yOmPNHL21M
Ugh. I have 3 days left to make this money or no internet. I'm just realizing this NOW of all times. Pray for me, I think sleep no longer counts as an option if I want to keep my internet on 😭😭😭 #help
Fuck me no signal for days actually about 5 minutes before saying oh you want it THATs the way forward.
@Bluestockingmum @woofit79 @BBCNews They always do. It's just normally we're all on the march with no signal.
@goibibo Your customer care agent raised a ticket and asked me to respond to the same email with files from my end (which I did). It has been two days now and there has been no communication after the initial phone conversation. How do I proceed?
@ACTFibernet Very bad service.  More than 30 hours no internet in home. Ticket No:SR10331469088262  . Almost 1 or 2 days in every week, I am facing internet failures. If this is the situation, I have to disconnect your services.
Not having no phone a different kinda ass

@VodafoneUK 11 days in total and next to nothing has been done. I get promised phone calls when things are done, but no phone call. I have to chase. Yet still nothing has been done. Poor customer service and I’ve tried complaining but heard nothing back!! Please sort this ASAP!!

I'm very disappointed by the service of @officiald2h ... Always showing no signal or other issues but home channel is showing... Whenever I call to customer care they give silly reasons

@nuency25 @ClimateAudit @JupiterWalls @ombudsman4truth @sunmaster14 @ProfMJCleveland @HansMahncke There is no Presidential route for surveillance on US Persons, it’s a myth. That is for authorizing surveillance on enemy facilities that have no communication with Americans, so like a Russian Navy base.
Same is happening with me account no#1145374633, @HathwayBrdband  your network sucks..for last 10 day there is network issue. Either there is no internet for hours or when it comes it gets disconnected very soon..using @JioCare or @Airtel_Presence  hotspot for internet. https://t.co/ly4q5pZxHH
@trey_sheppard @shadxjose Bruh . Smh no phone or nothing
having no phone is really ass
@WizardWhistle No phone is more durable than another tbh. Put on a tempered glass, use a good case, and dont bring it near water ever. Phone batteries will always degrade with time/use but the Note 10 battery is the best out of these choices.
@pammy3006 agreed. Just a term created.  The old days was no phone call returned.
Let me just hop on lea- oh yeah, no internet Let me play smash onli- haha...Well I’ll just watch some ani- fuck

In 1999, NASA lost communication with the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter. A contractor had written a program for the orbiter using imperial units, as is standard in the U.S., but NASA’s software used the metric system. https://t.co/CiIgbjHHZM our @charles_duan in @Slate
@Zlatan_Ibile Na so we were suppose to vote for you.  But no phone to vote it. P
@VZWSupport Both. Some places outdoors we get no signal. Same with indoors. Dropped calls, no service, etc. If we move to certain areas in the house, we get at most three bars. It’s been going on since we have had smartphones-years.
@OptimumHelp I AM REPAIRED! KUDOS TO EMILE! HE WAS HERE ALL AFTERNOON! How do I get a credit for all the time that my service has been going in and out? Almost 2 months! One day I had no service, the next day I had tv but no phone or internet, the next it was vice versa! Two long months!
I HAVE NO SIGNAL HERE I MISS EVERYONE AND BTS
@TabithaKhaye No phone, no fb, no communication, except twitter really, so often I just venture out hoping to run into somebody, but alas, either they also avoiding the slander, drama, etc, or I just don't matter that much I guess, except to be pestered, and annoyed.. *Le Sigh* Fml, now I am
@dana_howl Love the idea... but i would like to see it executed using a $10 budget and no internet access.$50 per month is what most of us already are doing (or would like to be doing)
No internet, no WiFi. 💩💩💩Can’t even tag Northwestern to voice my displeasure...
She literally is happy im phoneless
What is the thought process whereby a person decides to text another person they barely know after 4 yrs of no communication? Do ppl just scroll through their contacts and randomly text ppl? I'm curious abt this but not curious enough to respond to the random that just texted me https://t.co/69Q2B3AJH0
@pulte @PulteDaily I might be without power and all contact if pg&amp;e moves their shutoff line even half a mile, no phone Wi-Fi nothing. A cheap hotel for the weekend would be a blessing
@shivers_raymond @matthewfleming @Da3LeggedFreak @TheDivisionGame Go into a discovery raid match make tell me how that goes.

A week with no internet connection and no response from your team except to give a ticket. Are you lacking in manpower but still getting new clients yet fail to service those who already have accounts with you? https://t.co/iJxlb05qr7
@sheryljames She was arrested last Saturday. No phone call till yesterday. I have a feeling they helped her detox, although I haven't asked. She  always knows that I will talk to her no matter what. I won't pay her bail again, tough lesson learned, for me.
@TerrapinRow What’s a better way to study than with no internet?

#donedelete no phone.
@purrcarriemeow @LoomesGill @sarasiobhan @POhWERadvocacy @CitizensAdvice Its easy money ... Vulnerable adults can't make to the walkin's and there's no phone number and no staff to help.

BasementCon is off to a rousing start.We have no internet and no WiFi, not any TV, in the location. We have three DVDs provided to us by the lodge owners. They are Master and Commander, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and three episodes of season 2 of Duck Hunters.
@aurajinallamour Exactly!!!! I always told myself I would never treat my kids how my mom did us . There distant love and no communication in this house . It's so crazy but I've grown out of having feelings towards that it literally doesn't effect me anymore . Sometimes you have to grow up before

#DanfoNigeria’s symbol of anyhowness.The buses have no signal lights or mirrors. They always look beat-up, they deface our roads. Everyday, someone is bashed by a danfo. The drivers are not licensed, you can’t do anything to them. But everyone is just causally ignoring. https://t.co/P1xNr8IHjt

@AmazonHelp Fire stick is plugged into TV and power power source (wall). TV set to hdmi, no signal. Fire stick won't turn on. Power cord was tested and is fine. Hdmi adapter was tested and is fine. TV hdmi port was tested and is fine.Seems the issue is the stick itself.

@Tesla ...with repeated followups till 10/23, i was told there was no loaner available and on 10/24 all followups stopped from SC. No phone calls were returned to me either. Is this how you guys treat customers who spend a $100 Grand on a car, you should be shameful.!
@_heylauren Worst part is no communication from the devs at all at least address to the community you know of/ are working on the issues or if they feel like it is something that they don’t want to take out the game at least tell us so we all don’t have to tweet out the same issues :(
highly considering going phoneless 2020
@OoredooMaldives Hello @OoredooMaldives, it's no Internet. Again.

@IsayIsayIsay1 @ThreeUKSupport And in the mean time I’m posting for unlimited data, getting no internet access, having to use free wifi just to google for updates because you don’t think it’s important to either keep the network running or keep customers informed
@JeffreeStar I have like no internet connection so I can’t😭😭

@hage_mo Hi, you messed up our Lufa Farms delivery, and there’s no phone number to get hold of the delivery guy to fix it. Disgraceful service, and no way to rectify. We expect a full cash refund.
I literally have no phone for the next few days feck
@PurolatorHelp No card...no phone call...please examine how I'm suppose to know I have a package in!? Most times I don't even know which courier a company is shipping to us with. I have to run all over town trying to find my packages. I will insist on companies not using Purolator to avoid this
Week two with no phone and it’s been a struggle
@PurolatorHelp There was no card. So no card, no phone call. Am I suppose to be a mind reader?? 2 WEEKS IT WAS THERE. So I finally go get it and with my back out, carry the 70 lb. package up the stairs.  If this was the first time this happened that would be one thing but it has happened before
It seems like every month that I have to deal with @GetSpectrum outages or some kind of interruption due to crap equipment. No internet or cable for a second day. https://t.co/Lp8s1gQFhT
@PurolatorHelp I was told there was no phone call by your depot because the phone number wasn't in the label. I contacted the company I bought the item from and they say they sent it and you didnt put it on
@Scottcrates @ResisterSis20 Luxury prison with no internet, only classic books. They serve only RAW vegan food. Goat Yoga class is mandatory, as is the strict no makeup or hair products policy. Hey. Hell is what hurts the most. This is his Hell. https://t.co/N2vcHVZx0T
@PurolatorHelp Shipping by courier is to get items fast. I have been waiting and calling trying to find my package to find out it has been sitting FOR 2 WEEKS at the depot. No card at my office (and it was open the day you claim you attempted delivery) and no phone call...
@hsieh_zachary Dang I actually need it I have no phone just a I pad

@VZWSupport I have no internet service and can only get one or two bars. I was bumped up to another rep who assured me that verizon wasn't throttling me. He had me swap out my Sim Card, but that didn't aolve the problem. This has been an escalating issue for about a year.
@paul_winginit It's great no phone signal you can relax. Nothing reason why i like not having WiFi on flights not forced to check my emails

When you crack your phone screen and @USCellular says they will overnight you a new phone: 😊When its been 5 days and no phone so you call back and get told "oh, they didn't tell you they were backordered? Our bad. We don't know when you will get one": 😠 Thanks USCellular 🙄

Nothing makes me feel old like hearing my husband explain to my daughter there was no internet, smart phones or Netflix when we were kids.
Over 50+ days no internet and today was our drop team appointment and they no showed. Again. For the third time. How is this an escalation @TELUS @TELUSsupport ? I think you’re lying to us. How does your drop team no show 3 appointments in a row and over 50 days straight?
I can’t with ESOL students man😭 one goes to his friend “Thor fono signal ar ni beh amar tath ‘no signal’ aya boythakseh” 😩😂😂😂

@SonicTelecoms Hi Sonic, less than 48 hours into a new Contract with no signal. I want out now. Please come and collect your Installation materials.
@sebas05000 @ari_bloch @JohnLegere @NevilleRay Typically poor quality SINR and RSRQ I suspect are the issues in this area.  Looks like T-Mobile must be actually working on it today - no signal from that site.. but typically getting 3/5 'bars' from a site up on the hill.  Overlay in this area may be the key.
glad i don’t fw no internet ass nigga, y’all be embarrassing yourselves on this app

This ain’t no phone plan when I put my brothers on
@AITA_reddit YTA, she has literally no idea why you’re acting like this due to no communication of past feelings of any sort. I’ve had a few guy pals I was close with from hs I tried to reconnect w/ that were rude n cold to me, most likely cuz Im married now. Friendship ain’t enough for some
@Ask_Spectrum so 5 days no phone or internet in Charlotte NC for me and my neighbor's. Is there a reason for this?

@bt_uk what an insult no internet till Tuesday the engineer didn't even bother to show up after spending the whole afternoon in the house. My son has disability and needs the internet to keep occupied. Again BT said they are going to call but nothing again

Dear #RealEstate industry,You really need to start putting the ISP's available and the internet speed packages available where a house is located. It's just as, if not more important, than the school systems. I wouldn't move to a house that has slow/no internet.
@SunTrust Hey Suntrust fraud department , when I disputed a transaction 2 weeks ago, and now you finally decide to fix it, how about letting your customer know you shut down their debit card instead of letting them find out in public.  No email...no phone call...you suck.  0 NPS.
Is Victoria's Secret an alternate dimension, or something. That's what it feels like. And there's no signal in here, but there is everywhere else in the mall.

@RiotL4T3NCY @Mortdog Turning a team score of 2-14 from complete loss, tilt and no communication into a team that worked together in the end. Myself and 2 other members remained positive and gave our all, eventually the others followed, this game promoted me into platinum for the first time. 👌🏼
There’s no signal in this bitch
@selenagomezsax @selenagomez Cape Town = Load shedding = no internet connectivity😭😭
@mattliebowitz @ATT Seriously, though...all these years, I've been paying ATT for "Cell phone service" while all I've had was the grace of broadband service??? No internet connection, no cell coverage. What exactly was I paying for?

Guess everyone was a fan

@R0zzyB0wden @JuddLegum It’s not just Facebook. It’s the dominant cyberlibertarian credo of Silicon Valley. Barlow published the playbook back in 1996–The Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace.

@OsirisTenkuryuu The game we played when we had no internet at the time 😭😭
@bt_uk Already ran the checks and it’s an issue outside the home. It says estimated fix of Wednesday, no internet that whole time?
Not only is government NOT the problem, it’s actually the only tool we have to combat the largest problems facing man-kind. We can not tackle things like climate change, poverty, etc.. without it. Without the government there would be no internet, GPS, society as we know it.
@martolinakiwi @LATAM_PER I'm in the same line. Since 10:30am and now 2:49. No communication from @LATAM_PER to passengers in line. Safety is one thing; customer service is another.

Received an email from a temp agency last night for a great short term assignment. I replied with my updated resume &amp; availability. And then today...nothing. No email reply. No phone call. You are a piece of meat to temp agencies. I got my hopes up for nothing. Feeling the sting.

Really bummed my @JeffreeStar halloween mystery box got cancelled somehow. Went from having a pending charge on my bank account to not having a charge at all. No communication about it either. :(
@CSGOEmpireV2 @sync1080p @_Sliced_ Yeah it's a learning curveball with this CS system but yh your system will improve but your customer service to high rollers won't improve and communication within your support team. When I worked for you for two years it was really disorganized, no communication between teams
@SKYserves Youre testing my patience again. There is still no internet as of this day! Location is not even on the list.
@NeedsAManDuh_ @_sabrinalana_ @lexitherealone @saul_rubio10 @RashidaZakiya @gabbshyphy @xberryhes @kyleeeeannn @itsthahope @keIseazy @LandonBagby @siimplyjayy Okay so.

I’m ready for this era or whatever that I get to meet y’all.
@gram63 @BBCRadio3 *runs up and down boat hysterically at the thought of no internet...again*
@IndiGo6E our flight (Bombay to Delhi) has been delayed. No communication and heads up given to us about this.
@_woollyback @RokoshME @united_roll @Lumberist So although I see the need to reduce, I also see that we are improving. If you want to help so desperately you might want to look at what you can do, no internet, no phone, no fridge, no runners, no synthetic fibres,canoes, bikes, trains, cars etc! We still need to live
This guy just cut in front of me w no signal and then proceeded to go UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT WHY
no phone really got me out here communicating with people on this old ass pc.....oh man 😂
Things I like and dislike about Night Shift Like :Less people to deal with No Managment Dislike :Little to no communication with coworkers and boss. Little to no resources.
@virginmedia  absolute disgraceful service and appalled for any customer. No internet since 7am, 3 phone calls later in excess of 40mins waiting and the resolution is a new hub to be delivered. Shock can’t get it until Tuesday. Looks like SKY @skytv_ is going to get my custom
@kohiyote when the day comes where I need to look at furry porn in a Target with no phone data, I'll remember your brave words

@paul_winginit You can’t get a signal because of the train or because no signal even exists outside of the train ?
@_thedrrew Live the life! No phone, just a couple mfs living in the moment 😂
Put my order in for fibre broadband with @VodafoneUK nearly 6 weeks ago! Was meant to go live today (for the third time) but surprise surprise... still no internet. Steer clear. #fibre #broadband #internet
The higher education system in the UK is a joke. No support, no communication, completely elitist. I want to learn and grow and go on to be qualified for my dream job but it seems like an impossible task unless I suddenly win thousands on the lottery🤷🏻‍♀️
@dhh I stumbled on them while searching for a sketchy guy I knew 20 years ago who has no Internet presence but apparently a couple of DUIs.I paid them $1 for the 7-day trial membership and canceled it right away as it seems they won't actually provide the extra info they promise.

Before the communication shutdown, things were looking up for young Kashmiri entrepreneurs. Now, with funds drying up and no internet, more than 100 startups in the valley have had to put the brakes on their dreams. https://t.co/AvAEqTAN5P
@NippySweetyLass Yeah, but there's no Internet in woods and therefore, no Twitter for him to throw around his wisdom...
There should be no phones so you don't bitch why there is no faculty in your deptt. There should be no phone so you wouldn't shoot what ABVP does in your campuses. There shouldn't be phone so you don't post your grievances with SSC on twitter. There shouldn't be phone at all.
@Walmart @Apple to the labs or hire labs to find the problem or better yet constantly check whether their are loop holes were china or usa ir havkers can penetrate it also when power went out in northern cali i found i had no wifi no phone no lights how will thst work

@phattuck @drawandstrike @drawandstrike jinxed it. No phone book, no action.
So we’re $100 out right now, and have had to deal with no internet, a rude @BestBuy employee, false claims on @NETGEAR s website, and just pure frustration. This week has already been so emotionally draining and we really didn’t deserve to have to go through this.
@VirginMediaIE No internet access on my WiFi (again) and your customer care line is constantly engaged. Explanation please?

No communication, no updates, and then no help with flights the next day. Cant see how they didn't see the crew issue potentially being a problem - could have allowed passengers to make other arrangements earlier. Pretty dreadful 2/2.

@JohnLegere No phone
@robreiner @jenelr I totally agree. On a less serious note, I could hear Archie saying “They don’t impeach a president over no phone call Meathead.” Carroll O’Connor is gone on but I can tell you AllIn The Family was the greatest show of all time. No one could play Archie like Carroll O’Connor.
@ATTHelp my technician has not showed up to my scheduled appointment with no phone call. Glad i took off work...
Let's talk about services the Lebanese state provides to its citizens:Water? Barely Health care? A big NoInternet? Slowest in the worldElectricity? NoInfrastructure? NoQs arise to where did international loan money go &amp; why shld citizens pay taxes w/o receiving services?

@KingFrench23 @ImDukeDennis yo honestly this is true. 2k jus took their event away without even syaing the future of it. if fortnite disables a mode u can see at the bottom of ur main screen that its being checked on and is being looked at. we get no communication back towards us.
3. Morning routine. Wake up, meditate, cold shower, no phone usage, journal &amp; hit the gym.
Interesting how things come to a halt when the internet is down. Heard someone crashed into a major wiring hub and they don't know when it'll be fixed. No internet in an entire city. Fun times.
@johnsolomonbain @ToryAmerican @QueenSeraphine I lived a good part of my childhood in a farm back in Ukraine. Life was hard as hell for my grand parents who lived there, especially during the winter. There was often no electricity, no running water, no phone and no TV. Now I live in a city. Guess where its easier?

We can if you want. I’m not sure what the drugs are for, but I have a brain wave reader and can control a single bifurcated axis fairly reliably with a 15 second lead time. We can also play the google “no internet connection dinosaur page” via blinking. What else do you want? https://t.co/6lYeKuqCiV
I Honestly Need A Break From Reality and everyone ... I’m talking bout no phone no nothing
@theingthing In this instance, as the customer is on the edge of that cell, network service deteriorates and can result in intermittent service. Naturally, if both the primary and neighboring secondary cells are powerless, there is no signal at all.

One time, when I was in college, my dad and I got in a fight over the phone and my dumb ass hung up on him. He DISCONNECTED my cell phone. I was across the country...with no phone. Never did that again 💀

@VodafoneUK what happens when you guarantee a date for broadband connection and fail to deliver? Asking on behalf of a family member who’s been waiting over 5 weeks now. Is your ‘guarantee’ meaningless? And no they can’t message you personally because they have no internet!
@OpenreachHelp 3 weeks and counting of no internet at our new address. How hard can it be to get an ENGINEER TO SHOW UP. They say moving house is one of the most stressful things you do in a lifetime, well you have added to that ten times over. Thanks, truly.

@revuwution i see!!! i was kinda a joke when i started. was 9, libraries had no internet, learnt BASIC from a 15 year old book,
@Trutherbotanyo2 I certainly am. All day bike rides with no phone, no fear of 'what if...'; not being constantly bugged by worried parent: 'Where are you? What time you coming back?' No addiction to sharing your every move with your 'followers' on social media. Just out and enjoying the day.
U meet someone. You 2 get close. It’s all great for a while. Then someone stops trying. Talk less. Awkward conv. The drifting. No communication whatsoever. Memories start 2 fade. Then that person u know becomes the person u KNEW. That’s how is usually goes, right? Sad isn’t it.
Guys I know how to fix the 3 no signal !You just turn/switch your phone off then switch it back on again! This worked for me and I tried it with my mum so I think it fight work for other people!
@LizSpeidel @AncientLitDude Times havd changed drastically and not for the better. When I was in my twenties (Lincoln was in office!), there was no internet, cell phones or SM:) if a guy wanted to get in your pants, he had to impress you. If they still do, they still do for me! 😉Stand your ground!

@ThreeUK So I have service back after going to/from airplane mode, but no WiFi calling. I've seen no official mention from @ThreeUK of issues remaining. Is that a known issue? I get no signal at home or work so WiFi calling is essential to me
No phone call. It’s okay we only like Chips Ahoy Chewy here anyways 🖕🏿
@Cricketnation Your rep said that I had no signal anywhere because a tower was down. A week later with no signal still I called your tech support. There were no towers down. Your rep lied. I don't trust your company at all.
@virginmedia That link seems to be broken. I entered my postcode and it says no known issues. But I have no internet and when I called Virgin the automated service says there is a fault and the lady said it will last till the 24th.

I have no internet game bro... I'm only good in person
@spankysick @kjchaifisch @chronic No phone plan? And google voice when you are connected to wifi, out and about? There are many reasons. Being able to call 911 and get emergency alerts via Cellular without paying is beneficial.
Then, after doing this, I go back to place order screen only to be told I have no internet connection. I then go out completely to attempt again and am told I already have a purchase in process. I go in again and my cart is empty. What's going on? And now I have nothing.

@AndroidAuth @adityude You're right there's no phone with radar already in the phone but the app has been out for a very long time and it's not as good as it could be and the pixel is very similar to the app. Why buy something you could get for free on a better device?
@ClnHz I think it is worth a try, especially if you explain why no internet (no radio links, no cables, no satellites)...

@Fozziebear17 @ReadingFC @pnefc Trouble is there is only one number to ring. I could book online but you don't get the discount if you book online and I can't get hold of anybody to speak to. I even rang the hotel who were taking a message round to them but still no phone call :(

time to study no phone
@jcasmon That’s about where I’m at with it too. I don’t recall floppy disks being the height of security when they were commonplace, but I get why it would work now (since access to computers that would be able to utilize them &amp; have no internet connection are minimal).

@Sarah_Kelly678 @AshCashmore You and I clearly aren’t going to see eye to eye.  Just because you’ve had situations that worked out doesn’t mean the parents who don’t show don’t want to Have parents with no communication because they are hiding from ICE raids... promise you they “want to”
@TfL Thanks, Dee. Unfortunately I've just wasted another 20 minutes filling out that form which it won't accept because there isn't a valid "Station" option. I'd seen that form before but noted it said it couldn't be used for Refunds. There are also no phone options for my complaint

No mother is perfect, only human.  To be judged, ridiculed, and estranged from your own children, I feel to be the deepest pain to endure.  I do not know what I've done.  No explanation, no communication, and no love for sure. This is slowly killing me, and they have no idea.

No internet and trolley card machine not working on train from Dublin to Cork. Does @IrishRail set out to intentionally make the train so unattractive that people simply drive instead? Or do they simply not give a crap? https://t.co/PbqZN51e8s

@gregwrightYP Thank you. I am really worried what may happen after the review. Time for settlement? I have letter stating not taking any tax payers house. But what will happen? Financial charge will be just as bad. Will lose jobs. What are they planning, no communication. So stressful.

@MattTarrant @NBN_Australia We've been in our house 4 months too and the exact same thing has happened no internet
@ThreeUKSupport No signal or data here in Glasgow. Serious, this is getting ridiculous. And yes, I've tried turning it off and on again and frankly, at this point it's getting offensive that you're blaming this on customers.
@virginmedia I have rebooted and it still not connecting to phones. iPads or Alexa. Just says “No internet connection”
@VodafoneIN was talking to someone on a call a couple of minutes ago and call got disconnected in between as NO SIGNAL appeared and network bars gone to ❌Happening so many times daily!

@AskPlayStation But an offline PS4, no internet connection, knows the online PS4 has signed in with the same account. How is my offline PS4 receiving the notification that I signed in with the same account somewhere else? Is someone pushing internet into my console or is there a backdoor?

We've been in our house for four months with no internet thanks to @NBN_Australia - it was meant to be ready to go on Wednesday. They have now updated that date, to the end of January 2020. Has there ever been a "business" as pathetic as NBN?

@virginmedia what is happening? No phone line or broadband services working!  Guy updated the cables on the 15th October. #poorservice
@ThreeUK network is embarrassing. From 8-4 Monday@to Friday I have no signal in the city!!! I never get signal at home. As for 3G what is it. Must be a way I can get out of my contract and change networks as this is a total waste of time and money each month. Get in touch

@VodafoneIN @Idea whats the use of paying you money every month when even basic call signal is not there. the network load is also not there to explain no signal even for calling forget data. Please improve atleast basic call coverage.
phoneless and this shit aggravating me so bad
@SatonmyButt @virginmedia We've had no internet from @EE and dodgy 4g from @ThreeUK apparently it's to do with the new 5g network. EE sent a token engineer to pretend to fiddle with some "crossed wires" my kids will mutiny today if it's not fixed.
@Habs_ The no signal is probably deliberate 😋😋😋
Saw someone sharing a modified version of the photo with the "I am not XX, I am Malaysian" except they replaced Others with a clown. Fuck you to the seven pits of hell I hope your car breaks down where you get no signal and your wallet is always full of *only* 5 cent coins.

#Cellphones being thinner is major screwup by phone makers. No room 2 add RF port on back of phone 2 use portable external antenna, &amp; boost signals on d go. How many of u have fits of anger @ phone co's due 2 low and slow signal from cell towers? 5G useless if no signal comes in.

If you ever really don’t know what to do with yourself because you’re like “fuck it all” I think sometimes it’s a good idea to go to a public place with no phone and read a book. Mild sociability, learning. It’s better than nothing.

@avg8 @GuitarSith @rwyjunior @paige_reale @CassieJFox @HotmaiBill @tricia62673 @oakgiraffes @offroadrj Using available wifi, log into news sources and download the content to take home and read offline (we had no internet yet) , even now 80% don't have access to Fiber  but I got it because I am right on the highway, so I have everything now, except Cellular service .
@VerizonSupport Just tried it and it still went to being a red globe still no internet
@AskLyft why am I not able to get assistance from you? This is pretty shameful. Charging me fees because a driver doesn't show? Absolutely ludicrous. No phone number to call? I guess I'll switch to @Uber
@lyft I'm pretty irritated that I cannot reach out to someone for assistance when you charge me for a no show fee. No phone number for customer support? Even Walmart has a phone number. I was standing on the sidewalk watching the driver circle the block before leaving.
So this is how it feels to be single single. Not one text in my messages, no phone calls, no fuckery. Thank u don’t come again
@SkyHelpTeam Really as far as High Wycombe as no internet at all still so what’s wrong with our areas ? We want refunds ? £40 a month for your WiFi and internet and now it cuts off for a whole day and you don’t even answer the phone to customers

More than 24 hours and counting. No internet again. Lol. This happens every month. @Converge_CSU

@matthewfleming @Da3LeggedFreak @TheDivisionGame If you matchmake for a raid chances of you getting a completion is slim to none , most players quit after a few fails on a boss, plus there will be no communication. They putting matchmaking in there will not help. Better off going into LFGs to find players
@RyanTheTwit I wont be able to make it. We lost our power due to the nor'Easter we were hit with last night. No power means no internet. Have fun!

@ND_Blue58104 @LeeHolly81 @realDonaldTrump So he wrote a letter? No phone call? Therefore no transcript? Is the publicized letter not enough for you?Letter was insane? I thought it was to the point and bold. Why do you think his letter was insane?
@enjoyGLOBE Your Globe at Home sucks! No internet connection and dial tone since Monday! Your cust rep told it should be back yesterday but still NONE! I called again just now and your cust rep told us you don’t know when it’ll be fixed? WTF! Napakawala ninyong kwenta.

No. Communication and space however is imperative. https://t.co/lhSdYzhaRG
@DAVID_LYNCH you are the one man save for the man with no phone that I ever expected to see on Twitter. You should be in a smoky bar somewhere, communicating by switchboard operator or seance.
GLOBE @talk2GLOBE you are the worst! No internet connection and no dial tone for our landline since Monday! What the heck!
I had issues with Monzo, not freezing account level but not being able to get access to money when I had no phone due to it being in for repair. (And no backup that could accept the app).Issue with the whole failing to store pins and other bits. https://t.co/UG7VxhCLns
Then your cellphone rings. You've kept it, even though there has been no signal in a long time.You remember how to turn on the screen. It's someone from your old life. Your friend? Boss? *Mother*? you can't really recall.You remember how to greet them.
Thanks @CoxHelp @CoxComm third outage this week. No internet or cable, good way to keep customers. No communication there was an outage until after speaking with a chat agent.
No signal, but he was two yards deep in the end zone. GO BRONCOS!
Oh yes and my 10 year old asked me “how did you cope growing up with no mobile phones and no internet and no... TIKTOK!” https://t.co/ZsC5Cj5yN8
3 days no communication? Fck😭
@StevenBeschloss @gotklss2 I want to rob a bank, tell the FBI to get over it, and then be on my merry way. I’ll let you know how that works out for me, unless I’m in prison with no internet access. 🙄
@BattleshipGarcy i wonder what @thaliashadow02 is doing on the anniversary. lowkey hoping she'll be on vacation with no internet

@jimmyfallon #collegeinsixwords Thank God there was no internet! 😅
@WaxPackGods Anyone remember the bogus Will Clark 1985 Topps Olympic card that went around in the 80’s? There was no internet back then of course. As a 15 year old I was fleeced for $18 🤦‍♂️
@AceBurpeeShow The Paddlewheel was the Saturday morning meeting place for a bunch of us guys to decide what we were going to do for the weekend. No internet or cell phones back then. lol
How did You deal with the language? Subtext: How did you satisfy that vital need o[ comrmmication? Or more precisely, an ideological assertion masked by the practical interrogation: there is no communication except in speech.
Slight panic moment: my patio tv told me “weak or no signal” on a black screen. Moving the antenna fixed it. Phew!
@anirbanmahanti No phone will replace a good Camera, but it became a convenient substitute
No power, no internet, no fun. https://t.co/bopHlb6V2F
@GregNorberg Put them in a room with no phone chargers, sit and wait.
@pikvh 😷😷😷 I rather be phoneless
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO COMMUNICATION SKILLS CAN SUCK A FAT ONE
@Shawhelp No internet or cable here all day. What’s up?!!
@VirginAtlantic @Delta Why you guys can’t communicate seeing as you preach about working together. Our flight out of LAS was delayed &amp; Virgin didn’t hold the flight 10 minutes so 10+ are stranded with no communication! Will definitely not be booking with Virgin Holidays again!
Wake up late and have to rush to get to therapy, don't shower, get home and the shower is being used, get told I'll be picked up soon and get told I can shower when I get taken to where we're going.Two hours pass with no communication.I wanna be clean oh my god WHERE'S MY RIDE
Umm @Ask_Spectrum wtf.....no internet and the cable is running like its buffering.  Come on!!
No phone all day; I could get used to this; it's been awhile
Why can’t I play the game offline, for example when on a flight? Racing against the computer requires no internet...
@cuppymusic Anthony Joshua my final answer.... no 50 50, no life line, no phone a friend.
@ZahraElmansoury silence the phone. Most of us naturally raised our hands. He said how uncomfortable we were is how a patient with GAD generally feels, all the time, except there's no phone to silence!
@SaWdAKiNg of course they did &amp; wasn’t no internet that may or may not have documented crazy shit they may or may not have done
@arcade_1up Your customer service is horrible. I have a defective machine yet it clearly says on the screen do not return to store. Poor communication. Better yet, no communication
Dear @iamMVP sir it’s your policy to treat a customer for 5 days NO INTERNET CONNECTION AND NO DIAL TONE? It’s how earn millions of peso from the customer who work hard to earn money to pay the service of your company you run? @PLDTHome @PLDT_Cares @pldt
no internet, marrige twice, telephone CS, IT work, anxiety attacks, paranormal experiences, restaurant *back end*, managing, 24hrs on a greyhound bus trip, climbed a mountain, parents divorce, walked 12 miles in dress shoes *took 4 hrs*, learned to play guitar..

@SJSchauer ok but even if they aren't the same person and even if it was a larger company there's still no excuse for it and I wouldn't want to work in a place where there's no communication going on???
Anyone else awake at 4.30am wondering which is worse...no sleep or no internet? #life

@_prettykea Damn it ain’t even 10; I just wanted to hear the stipulations of the no phone after 10?
the look on his face last night when I told him nga one week ko madula like no communication at all kay may camporal 💔
The tricky part is, even ppl from authority who issued the “no Internet cafe” advice, are not sure if that’s the right call, cuz there’re no written rules. What they’re doing is guessing &amp; risk management—in case one higher official find one unfavorable detail 6/x
@cheshire_cactus Always 24/7 Sometimes to the point of complete whiteout like an old analog tv with shit to no signal. If you want further info google #VisualSnow neurological syndrome. It’s a tough one to understand let alone explain &amp; comes in various intensities &amp; lots of accompanying symptoms
@DrPhil I’m sure the Chrisley’s were glued to their sofa and TV sets today. No phone calls, no visitors and absolutely... no talking. Let’s see what this snitch has to say https://t.co/kRxodX8b30

@wmnshealthcoach @IntactCervix Some are saying they'd rather have cancer but in that way people say 'I'd rather be dead' when something awful happens to them. Which is no signal to shun them as imagine wishing you had cancer over your current state! Compassion is so needed.
October 18, 2019 14th day  @PLDTMyDSL  NO INTERNET CONNECTION AND NO DIAL TONE.                            @PLDT_Cares  @PLDTHome  #PLDTNOINTERNETCINNECTION #PLDTNODIALTONE #PLDTBADSERVICES
@TeaPainUSA I spend the day hiking in the mountains with no signal.... when I come back to civilization this is what I see. It's like they're begging to be removed. That Whitehouse must be in complete chaos.

@metrolaalerts why don’t the drivers communicate with the passengers??? Bus 9802 for starters no communication on why it stop and the audacity to have an attidude to a passenger that got injured. If he does not like customers he is in the wrong work place.
@BillOReilly I took a 5-day raft trip on the Salmon R. in Idaho.  No internet in that area.  When we came out of the wilderness and got gas, USA Today was the only paper there that could tell me I had made a lot of money in the market those 5 days.

@Braddock512 @EA_DICE @Battlefield Can you see what’s going on with Firestorm?  Saying nothing for months, and then finally scrapping/not updating it with no communication in between would be kinda crappy.... if there’s bad news might as well come out with it sooner than later.

@Grumpy_Oldie Stand next to the door so you don’t sleep past your station. Done that pissed so many times, and you always end up somewhere with no signal, no taxis and one street light! Plus an hours wait until the next return train.
@BubbaJDAM I’ve listened on YouTube. There’s no internet by me, so I’m unable to stream anything without WiFi .
@masteromixes @TMobileHelp @cavschris @JohnLegere Yeah I wasn’t having issues before that were noticeable. But they are definitely noticeable now. I’m talking no signal. Zero. Since this started recently I must have accidentally changed a setting. I think it’s fixed now. Driving to Dallas next week so we will see.

My debit card just got denied at the liquor store while trying to buy 3 bottles of wine, a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of vodka. I only brought my debit it, no phone to transfer money, no credit card, no cash. I literally just turned around and left. Then went to a new store.
@HereInTheHollow @PhloggingAnOrse @BBCNews I can't go to the march because of family commitments so  I will retweet any stuff that becomes available. Experience of the previous 1 million march is they will have no phone signal though.
On my @Iberia flight: No internet, not even mobile internet. No power socket, so working time is limited to my battery which is already dead. No phone signals, I can't make phone calls to colleagues. So, I can't work. Ok, then let's relax.
I went home for the past week no cellphone no internet just my reading and journal and I must say it has done wonders for me... I've been in such a rut lately

If anyone has been trying to call/ text me I’m the last two days I’ve been phoneless and all my data erased so anything you’ve sent me was erased 😪 but I’m back! Lol
@JoshuaHiles @TheSmutGeek Ah yes. That argument is what I like to call "bolstering misfortune." The idea that if we deal with it young, it will be easier later.Its false. With no communication or coping mechanisms, it drives us to passive aggression, and serious stress.
Having your car stall with no phone SUCKS. I was so scared. I didn’t know what to do
Sooooo.....No phone. Dropped and blacked out the screen. Working off my iWatch until my new one comes in, so bare with me.

Had to navigate through London using road signs today Bcos Three want to offer me no signal
@ai_jared It would take more than tweets to respond to that. I'm a boomer. The biggest things that happened was that we were fooled that warmongering was over. Remember, no internet or alt-media to find out about regime-changes. Cold war and arms reduction-progress was made.
No internet for a release day, that’s nice 😪
I Fucking hate the wind. Trees are falling left and right and now I have no internet. Now I need to listen to music on my phone while I draw on my computer -_-

@BTCare no internet for 11 days! They lie. They don’t care, they love your money though.
Life it makes me crazy. Also, the privilege to expect internet to be Working continuously all the time. Is a privilege and something I take for granted. That being said I've no internet for the next month.
Would LOVE to go on the programme Hunted to see how far I could get with no phone interaction and limited money etc.
Anyways I'm going back to having no internet so goodbye 🥺 again

@Chime @SZavala1016 @whitannxoxo So what about the people who direct deposit you have accepted but not deposited in the account. What should we send while we are stranded in the middle of nowhere with an infant. No phone due to your app conflicts. No food. No gas and no response from your Customer service.

@AmpsNL @MrFifaPro @Hayk_guy @JonyIveParody @dbrand Don’t make this about Apple users. What I’m saying it that no phone screen protector should be able allow OTHER PEOPLE into your phone. If it compromises biometrics completely, fine, but the phone itself shouldn’t have that flaw. It’s dangerous.
@virginmedia It says no known faults! But still no internet! Tv has come back on now!
No Internet is better than slow internet. 🤮🤮🤮

@garrymoore2 When I was 19 I worked in the US and was there for three and a half months. No mobile phones, no Internet, nothing. I can remember writing one letter to my parents and one to my grandad.
@campmonday It must be a blessing in disguise to have no internet presence sometimes, do you ever miss being relatively unknown?
Appreciate all the support, honestly means the world. I’ll be outta town all weekend with no phone, but more vids to come 🤙🏼
@BritishGas @BritishGasHelp  still no phone call shocking customer service
@erikapprada Whatever you do, do not use Monzo as your main bank. It's one of those that goes great until the day they block you randomly. Then you are in a world of pain.  There's no phone customer service. It may take you weeks to access to your money!
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport I still have no signal what so ever and home alone with 4 small kids I don’t like the fact I don’t have a working phone especially with the amount of money I pay u each month
Hey @verizonfios it really sucks when you come home to no Internet, WiFi, and Cable. What ever the technical problem is please get it together.
@ninsoup I think I found out why. 1. I believe the plus release stopped being produced 2. Family that has no internet connection/data cap. 3. It's way easier for Sega to produce
I need a slight lil get away. No phones, no internet just getting my mind right.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport I have no data and no phone calls I need this to communicate with my family on a daily basis,also is there update on what is happening and it has effect me since last night,you need to sort this out or I'm not paying my bill simple as
@ThreeUKSupport @BBCWatchdog  can you look into what obligation phone providers have to their communicate to customers when a service is down? No service + no communication + sarky tweet = not good customer service! When things go wrong it’s about how you treat customers that matters most.
@EE utterly disgusted! No signal at home for 24hours, having to sit in a lay-by miles from home as I’m oncall! And 2nd iPhone device that’s had issues in the last few months and you’re refusing to do anything, shall be leaving once the contract ends

@ThreeUK Still dont have any service on my phone (my Mum doesnt have any service on her phone either and shes currently in Spain, with no phone thanks to yourselves) Its been off since 1am last night, no calls, no texts, no data...just not good enough!!
No communication at all for a week to the one person you talk to everyday, all day... that's the shit that sucks.
@jtyler220 @tweettruth2me I think 1800s, I wondered why in Colorado that someone didn't take an old ghost town and revive it, have a park-n-ride out of town, park and ride a horse to town, once there no phone, no electricity, less zoning laws, a large garden. The Gov wants to control everything
@virginmedia what is going on 2days with no internet at a premium rate and the earliest u can get here is Saturday it's a fucking joke!
Email down for 2 days, now no internet connection. Forgive my cynicism for thinking @GCHQ has dropped a ball.

@justheretolivef @cutelilragerr After finding this out I wanted to still wanted to know why it stopped just to have a clear Conscience. So I asked her after a year of no communication and turns out that horoscopes not matching where the reason. The END 😂
@VickyFlipFlop @monzo The airline has chared you, not Monzo. Airlines don't process payments in the air (because obviously there is no signal in the air), so to reduce costs they do them in batches on the ground. So it can take a while for them to take it. That is not the fault of Monzo.

@teganandsara The prevalence of phones are the reason I often pass on live music. I am in my forties and I long for the pre-phone days. This show was amazing for so many reasons, the no phone policy among them.  It would be great if all shows were phone-free!
@virginmedia I spoke to the team over a month ago and they told me I would need to contact you before the 16th October which I did last week via message as I was out of the county and had no phone, and have heard nothing back

@ThreeUKSupport @MatthewMorgans Pathetic that no communication was made to your customers, was going to use this tomorrow and then couldn't find it on the app and had to search twitter for any notice of it leaving. Wuntu just gets worse and worse. Waiting for the inevitable "we have better offers coming"🙄

@velobetty @monzo If this is the accounts getting frozen with no communication thing, it's happening to all banks now.  It appears to be some patterns of transactions triggering money-laundering checks and the regulations are pretty draconian.

@virginmedia It's affecting both. There is no internet coming through the hub at all. Base light is flashing green and WiFi light is on solid green. I've checked all cables are connected properly and restarted the hub.

Still no phone signal. 18 hours now @ThreeUK nearly lost a freelance job today.
@scyian @Elise_Thornton That's exactly right. I remember when the "modern phones" came in and everyone was wary because a power cut would mean you had no phone line. Now everyone is accustomed to it. We live out in the country and don't even have an option for an old style, reliable, landline
@virginmedia Why have you NOT answered my tweets in our 'private' conversation?I STILL have NO phone service.What IS the point of setting up private channel if YOU don't use it?Very  UNhappy with you.Please call 07756 766862 URGENTLY or I start FLOOD of anti-VM tweets

@markessien @zojie_ @NaijaFlyingDr You are very wrong Sir! Our population are most likely above 100M. Travel up north to towns that there is no internet.Do you know someone in Abuja doesn't know the man called Abba Kyari? The unlearned are so much that even govt data is below value.
seeing someone just slowly sip their coffee without looking at anything—no laptop, no phone, not even a book—is just so jarring now, and i’m envious
I think Florida driver may be worse than Bahamian drivers cause how tf do you go across 4 lanes of traffic with NO SIGNAL smt

@aristondo_g @byzantinepower Not even that. There was no phone or Internet or printing press.It took 500 years for the schism to materialize, end of 17th century, which jibes with Battle of Vienna 1683.Up until then inter communion continued.
@ThreeUK Mines still not on South Wales no internet and angry kids 😩😩
Well, after over a week with no internet (thanks AT&amp;T), and a few days helping out at Dollywood, I'm home with internet again!  Today is day 20 out of 34 at Dollywood Harvest Celebration, and Lisa was able to get some more painting done while I was there.
Not happy with the #Airtel #Broadband when I required to use internet at that time there will be no internet always need to call customer care give complained get same answer from them it will solve in 24 hours. @Airtel_PresenceAny options which broadband is good for Home.
@wttw @Cynthia__Duke thank you. After many scans and manual adds, the 4 channels are showing up when I click past them, but am getting no signal whatsover.
@ACTFibernet 3rd day and the service is still down. The worst part is there is no communication, their status page looks as good as nothing has happened.Do you guys even bother to respond to your customer requests? Is there any escalation matrix?
@comcastcares I tried that. Your contact us page provides no phone number with which to reach you. Neither does your reply to my initial query where I explicitly asked for a phone number. This only further tells me you are not actually motivated to serve customers.
@yourauntemma If his cognition is toddler level, someone needs to give him a very long timeout with no tv and no phone. Maybe a chore chart with gold star stickers too, to help motivate him 🌟
All now no internet. I’m so close to fucking them off kmt

@ThreeUK Not impressed at all. No communication with customers &amp; the problem is still there. It started at 23:40 last night for me &amp; has had little moments of working ok but still not right 😤
@FachtnaOwen How hideous. I'm so glad there was no internet in my youth. And no mobile phones. It's bad enough now! It makes me sad - sex, drugs &amp; rock n' roll used to be what being young was about.
I just exploded on the @comcast agent who informed me that tomorrow they will send a tech to fix the lines. Three days with no Internet. I am just damn over it. If it's not fixed again, I am cancelling service. This is unacceptable.
@ThreeUK so I tie down to a   2 year contract for 2 phones,I pay my first month then you decide to fucking implode with no signal and not on ounce of customer service to explain it? Absolute shite show of a company,going back to giff gaff stick your bills up you’re arse

@threemob any update on having ‘no’ signal all day!!!!??
Back in the day when there were no mobile phones, many storylines made sense only because characters couldn't talk to one another instantly. If you thought such plots would've vanished by now, you'd be wrong - “No signal” is the new “No phone nearby”:)

The kindness of strangers... Managed to lock myself out of the flat today - no keys, no phone, no wallet, no cash, no coat. Three hours later, after offers of soup, water, coffee &amp; the use of a phone, I'm back in. Could have been worse; I'd only just changed out of my slippers...
@gopsaidwhat @ToniTonit6 @POTUS I love this, but just a heads up: the Print Screen button will take a screenshot for you. You can just Ctrl + V straight onto Twitter. No phone necessary! 😀
No power at home, no internet at the mountain. Still pouring. Not a lot@of work getting done inside or outside today. Unproductive
@Xfinity We have no internet nor cable this morning in the Fountainbleau area near Doral, anyone know why? #nocable
stop using people who are desperate for a new phone for fucken clout lol especially when we all know that you have no phone to really giveaway... sht like this makes me so mad
@ACTFibernet Fast and speedy? No internet here since 2 days and your team has not even acknowledged my complaint."Your ACT Fibernet Request SR10131384366112 is expected to be resolved by  10/17/2019 03:00:00 PM"
Day 13 no phone - obsessively refreshing the postal tracking to see if my phone will arrive in time for my 5am flight tomorrow. I'm fine in a cabin without a phone. Travel these days without a phone is a bit more challenging.
@Xbox Oh yea, its tough solo running and no communication, that is more important than 34 kills. Il take a 11 game win streak over kills anyday. But! I was kinda happy with this one cause im not that good haha.
Travis has been gone for over a week with no phone and he’s still my number one best friend on snap if that tells you how much we usually snap 😂😂

@GDSTeam @HMRCcustomers Cheers for trying. These are old wills pre 1930. https://t.co/CQB3Wf7Mss No phone number for issues just online messaging. Hence my annoyance at delay and repetitive generic reply to any queries
@JCBelfast @ThreeUK how can I call a charity or my crisis team with no signal? 999 are not equipped to deal with that.
#DontUseHermes Appaling service. No means to contact them. No phone number. No customer service.
@SkyUK absolutely disgusted with the service from Sky. Still no internet or TV functions after a month and been told I need to wait another month, shocking

Many @ThreeUK users have reported they have no signal, with Three apparently struggling to get to the bottom of it. #telecoms #networks #outage https://t.co/Y6gpHjvtbc
@CoxHelp @joshr_martinez No internet in Norfolk. I just replaced my router and modem thinking it was them but this happens so frequently.
@ThreeUK I cannot do that on my dongle . Have no internet from 11pm yesterday . This is getting very frustrating because I cannot work without an internet connection which is equal to  wasting money plus losing money
@ThreeUK Quick enough to take your money but watch them run when you try and get something back because of POOR SERVICE. Had no phone or data for 15hrs now and if it wasn’t for the WiFi in the house I’d be lost. What u gonna do @ThreeUKSupport ? #threedown
@youwouldknow Ditto! Just went home because we've had no Internet since 10am! https://t.co/31FfaNzErN

Good afternoon.My ISP has been down since 23:45 last night, and as I use the same provider for my mobile phone, I've had no internet  and have been unable to make calls, which was handy!In the meantime liar Johnson has cooked up a shit Brexit deal, so I'm bloody fuming!
@EquusEngland I am extremely annoyed. I placed an order on Saturday 12th October (5 days ago). To date I have received NO communication from you, no order, nothing. I sent a message to you and I have heard NOTHING. I want to complain. Oh and I will be making paypal aware.

@BaldyNFL @AtlantaFalcons @AZCardinals Making this all the worse, there was play action to Johnson and no one even saw it or reacted. Everyone was bailing at the snap. So we have bad plays called, bad techniques, no communication or adjustments, very little awareness of the ball, and then cap it off with poor tackling
Due to the storm, the Library currently has no internet or WiFi. We will update you when it is back on.
Severally, I have reported this injustice to various Institutions such as; Nigeria Immigration, Egypt embassy in Nigeria &amp; In Egypt, Nigeria embassy in Qatar, Human rights in Qatar including, Global Justice including UN till date no communication till except from Nig. embassy QR

@GLapwing @GregHopper @JoyceWhiteVance @BmoreProgressiv @maddow And no phone or contact with the outside world.
@umidigi Bought the A5 pro from your official store on Aliexpress but 30days now and still no phone
@ThreeUK That might of helped if you had someone working on the network from last night. 11pm onwards I've had no signal to make calls or receive messages and obviously no data. This outage is shocking and the fact that it took you guy till the morning to put up a reply is a liberty
@MummyToTheMax @JCBelfast @ZabrinaN @ThreeUK That's not good &amp; no you wouldn't get through to a landline number, but all mobiles will jump across from your own network to whichever is available if you ring 999, this is the same if your in an area &amp; have no signal you can still call 999 no matter which network your with
@caffeinedad1 I blame Spectrum.  They refuse to service half of my area.  School kids have to go to McDs across state lines to use the Wifi to do homework.  There're hundreds of homes here that can't afford HughesNet's terrible service, so they have no internet.
@MarcSpiritClash @ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK Yh.....no signal for 3-4 hours for me.... No phone calling!!
@ThreeUK I've been rebooting all day. Still no signal.
@KCOMcare I am having issues with my internet. Everything seems fine and then my phone is telling me there is no internet available even though the router is connected and working like normal.
@kleinundrund I didn't have a thread. I had no phone O.O
@shannon_last I taught 8th grade. Email not an issue. Apps, social media, phone addiction, &amp; impulsivity are issues. Monitor closely. No phone in bedroom—especially at night. Make your child earn $$ toward the phone &amp; plan.
@Xythar they come from a very conservative place in america with no internet
Three has been down all day and I'm so glad I'm working from home because the thought of a day at work with no internet on my phone is too horrifying for words
@ThreeUKSupport can you help? Phone is showing no signal emergency calls only in USA
@OptimumHelp is internet down in 11747? Business phones work but no internet
@ThreeUK pay 4 unlimited but no Internet or services all day and it takes till 2pm for me to find anything out about it.
@JCBelfast @serialkillazzs @ThreeUK Not severe at all where did I state that ? What use would a house ohone be to me if I neded to ring someone when I’m out ? What if I can’t afford two lots of bills? What if there’s no phone line even installed in my home and I can’t afford over £100 to have one installed ?
@realDonaldTrump What actually happened:Nancy stands up and says in her "Mom Voice""I have told you again and again that until you clean up your behavior, mister, you have NO phone rights! No Twitter!  Go to your room. While you're at it, clean up that pigsty. Adam and I are tired of you."

@DaveEvanHughes "has no communication" is precluded by my tweet.
@ODEONHelp So you’ve changed the way you communicate these screenings. Last year we were getting emails ahead of each screening. This year we’ve had absolutely no communication regarding limitless - very very poor. We pay all this money and we’ve seen no improvement for limitless users.
We are heartbroken, devastated and disgusted at the treatment Sam is once again receiving from the HSE; no communication, no transparency and no plan going forward.
@clbolt Ok, well for those of us who are selfish, when someone who doesn’t follow back and has no communication except to be combative hijacks my entire TL they get unfollowed and if I STILL can’t get them off my TL bc of everyone interacting with them, I get selfish and they get blocked
@PorkchopSAR Right!! They better back the hell up!  JFK couldn't get us all in one place!  No internet!  Trump has that edge!!
@realDonaldTrump Did some one say "no phone today, you've been a bad boy" and they are making you read and reread your 12pm speech? Threatening you not to go off script? Are you going through Twitter withdrawals? go to jail crooked trump.2 sets of books and taxes, what a FRAUD.

How am I supposed to procrastinate on studying if I have no internet amd my phone isnr working???
@ThreeUK Almost changed phone to Three but as my old phone had stopped working online, had been stuck in the past with no signal when you were down so kept it separate. Did take some digging to find network was down not my just my mifi. Couldn't use laptop without mifi.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport still no signal whatsoever. Just signed up to a new contract and feel pretty annoyed that I've not even been informed of the issue or what you're doing to fix it. Update asap.
I have no Internet and I must tweet.Serially, it went down while I was feeding the cats.I hope these outages are because they're switching everything to the new fiber infrastructure.

No internet after last night’s storm makes for a very bored Bunni. Also doesn’t help that I have werid TFs on the brain and want to delve deep into them.
@HMS_Echo Can't read the pennant but under it 'no signal ' WiFi Broken then? and you are dragging your anchor. (For my life story see flags B and D)
The day I call into work there's no internet at home. Welp

@officialkappa99 @ThreeUK At least its only your internet,i had no phone signal so couldnt get in touch with anyone. They thought i was deid 🤣
I hate the company rn who are setting up glass Fibre in the surrounding area. They cut our line the second time now. Last time I couldn't even call someone for 2 weeks (no internet either). And now the same caseI pay 40 Eur for 16k (get 13k) and it's down often -_-
Being without power is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, no classes so I get to sleep in, on the other, after I sleep in I’ve got all this free time to do almost nothing because I have no power and no internet. So cold showers it is I guess
But the Internet is back, and so I can get to uploading that video that I wanted to upload on freaking Monday and is now very overdue. My work has been curtailed by 2 weeks of no Internet. So has my partner's. It's been ridiculous.
Interestingly, she didn't seem inclined to do anything about this until we contacted our landlord after a week of no Internet to find out wtf was going on. Only then did she actually start working on getting the problem fixed.
@pbaines86 And I though I was having a bad day - no phone thanks to a Three outage and the exhaust dropping off my car. Luckily I got it to the garage becasue breaking down with no phone would have been too much fun for words!!
I wanted to upload my video today but I had no internet, ig I'll do it now

Almost two months of no communication. Wow 😑
@LaurHof11 You just get a generic e-mail to renew? No phone call from your rep? No personal e-mail even? Wow
@mjshrimper It's TV that calls the tune, and the clubs have been stupid enough to cede total control to it for bucks. No one, that's no one, will be surprised if they are not out today. And still no communication.
Got my new phone yayy! Can’t set it up or use it in anyway becuase we’ve had no internet for five days. Boo!! 😩 #talktalkhelpus

@NehaLamba11 I don't mind time........but still I have no communication from themThat's what is pissing me off
@ThreeUK This has been going on for days! The irony being that to report an error you either need to phone (no signal) or log on to their website (no internet).
@CoxHelp no internet in Chesapeake, VA. Is there an outage?
@Cordicon Q hasn't gone anywhere,  just lost communication with us temporarily 😁
@koolovelies slow burn, angst, hurt/comfort, heavy angst, historical setting, mentions of death, whipped wwx, whipped lwj, misunderstandings, no communication, pining, mutual pining, 250k ongoing.
So we have no internet or heat at the office, and a power surge must have killed the fridge. Yay. Giving this half an hour to get sorted and then I'm gone.
@ThreeUKSupport Last night around 11 lost my data no internet can’t use my uber app or navigation 🧭 lost a days money as I do Taxi 🚖 still system is out 24 hours nearly now hope 3 can give compensation

@TheGroveGooner @girlscoutbadger @hidingnparadise @RacismDog are all these folx living in a cave with no internet access and no libraries? that’s the only way you can claim to “not know” about history and the fact is not okay to say italso, there is no such thing as “casual racism”. it’s just called racism 😉
@WolfRewardz I was receiving a dm from you but that time I have no internet for 2 days and seems like I failed the giveaway :’)
I'm kinda up north with barely any reception and no internet.So literally everyone doing these claims on the Reddit post are lying to try to bury my channel, I've never griefed in CTR.... absolutely depressing to see. https://t.co/fUfUq6NxvI
Well, tweeting will likely be limited since there's no wifi in the meeting rooms and in a few of them I have no signal. I'll share the Google doc at some point.
who started the rumor that having no phone can stop me from not paying attention in class https://t.co/MuHlNsHAsb
Kain means no phone#TNTBoysTogetherWeFly @TheTNTBoys @TNTVersions
@littlemore20 That's a good idea, we were all alone with no communication

@flipkartsupport You should end the exchange offer. There is no phone in the world scratch less  after using
@leejwesty @FOSTER_0161 Yeah, I’m fine with WiFi but it’s no go when I’m out. It was showing a signal but also saying no internet connection when trying stuff online.
Welp so much for getting to work early...😳😁😤 Power dip in the building... Lines down.. No internet... No nothing.. Grrrrrrr...
@ThreeUKSupport Three has been going downhill for months. Can’t even get signal in the city centre of the oil capital of Europe on a good day. Absolutely no signal since about 1am and no timeframe provided as to when it’ll be fixed. Useless.
@virginmedia So after @virginmedia cocked up transferring an account into my adult sons own name (he's still no phone, no access to the account) I cancel my own mobile contract too so they send me a bill for an outstanding 42p that needs paying immediately else they'll take further action 🤣 https://t.co/gE336iFMnz

@HitachiHomes Madam no message from Hitachi care and no phone call
Having no phone service today really shows how much I rely on my 4G signal. I’m barely connected to WiFi even while at work, so this is an interesting change of routine.
@vumatel Logged the ticket with my ISP MWEb - MWB12346014. No internet connection yet.
@Teary_Ennui @NotRightRuth In school? Absolutely nothing. (UK, state school 1973 to 1984)The Troubles were in the news a lot during that time.I had to find out for myself what it was about (no internet, no Wikipedia, no Guardian explainers, and I don’t remember seeing a book about it).
Still no signal this is a joke #threedown @ThreeUKSupport
My morning commute was like being in the post-apocalypse. Giant trees in the road, traffic lights out, flooded streets and now no internet at work. Fun day ahead
Seems EE is having real problems.  No signal for more than two weeks in this part of London and now the live chat is closed.
So, no,"Internet of Things" companies will not dominate anything. Platform companies that successfully provide uniform and integrated development experiences across all tiers and scaling from micro-controllers to intelligent network assets to hyper-scale clouds will.

@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport what’s going on 3 !! No internet, no calls, no texts nothing !! Since like midnight ... what am I actually paying for ... sort it out !! And I think we should be compensated for this issue too
@ThreeUK Everyone is saying they’ve had no internet or anything for 9-12 hours. Mine started around 12pm yesterday! I’ve had to use my talktalk internet because I’ve not been able to use my own. Just has three dots for 24 hours 😑 please hurry up &amp; sort it @ThreeUK
@kmckee7 @Eva61166023 Well, Europeans too. Taking a road trip to the "next town" in North Dakota sounds to my this year ears like a stupid idea, but back then, no Internet you know, so let's look on a map, and do it. Somehow, after the border, the numbers on signs started to drop slower, ...

Not sure when this tweet will reach the world, but this is just to say that after an office power cut, we've still no internet connection (Wi-Fi, sure – but no connection to the web). Even my mobile is struggling for signal on @O2. (Actually, why IS reception so bad in London?)
@ThreeUKSupport   no signal at all today..... how am I supposed to run a business?? #appauling
@historygirl27 Was wondering why I've had no signal all morning!
the fucking power is out at my house AND the tower is down so i had no signal so i had to wait til i got to WORK to find out what bbc has done
@Gr4ceyx @ThreeUK Mine ain’t I still have no signal
rah so 3 left man with no signal at all
@robotodd There's only one phone brand that consistently beats them all, which also happens to be the supplier of all those screens: Samsung. No phone out there has a better display than currently on the Note 10. Period. Only to fall behind even more once the S11 comes out with new tech.
@timesofindia Got first hand information from someone who had visited from J&amp;K.  Shops permitted to open just for 2 hrs  6am to 8 am and 2 hrs 6pm-8 pm. Business have either shutdown or on the verge. No internet. Life is a living hell. #KashmirNeedsAttention #Kashmir #KashmirNeedsAVoice
@Suddenlink @SuddenlinkHelp Day 11 with no internet @Suddenlink  @SuddenlinkHelp
My friend Blazej did a weekend where he did nothing that would get him dopamine. So he ate very little, didn’t have coffee or tea, no Internet, just meditation and journaling. Sounds like it could be a nice detox / experiment. I might try that (for like a few hours at first)
21 days since I’ve placed an order for the new 11 pro and still no phone. @Apple just looks like an incompetent company, if Fenty beauty can hold enough stock, Apple has no excuse.
@JioCare I am Using Giga fiber, No internet from last 5 days, logged complaint, ticket closed by customer care with no resolution yet?? Area-Hadapsar, Satav nagar, Pune

@ctvottawa fyi, no signal over the air. Other stations from same tower working ok.
When we’re sharing the @LNER menus around in 1st class like loaves and fishes.And their WiFi is making me register my details 1000’s of times but giving me no internet.Oh hello #BrexitBritain I’ll take my swift demise now. #FirstWorldProblems https://t.co/xWSrXyF9hH
No internet so take care of yourselves whiles I'm not around. 😡
@bitchimJEFF @KawallaButt @yveddevy_ @Chime To be fair - I had an issue similar to this with Huntington a few years ago. No communication whatsoever from them. Not even a twitter update. (Teller couldn't access my money either) As far as bancorp bank being down they also own paypal and  paypal has been working fine
@BBCBenThompson @BBCBreakfast I did - about 0030 &amp; 0230! And both phone and HomeFi® broadband router failed to reconnect. Phone finally connected to 4G just before 1000. Router still showing no signal. I'll try resetting it again... It appears to be working again after 13 hours outage!
@ThreeUKSupport iv still got no signal or data and I'm a carer also suffer with epilepsy so I need it back up and running soon not in a few days I'm having to us a friend's wifi
Rajasthan Day 4: Remote village of Madhogarh, where we stayed in a castle on a hill. Told to imagine we had gone back to 1930s... no internet, phones, hot water, but a fantastic room and stunning views in every direction. https://t.co/mq0ZFoLkLq

@AmazonHelp No, I did shopping and my account was blocked.says wait for opening. it has been 3 days. no communication?
@iD_Mobile_UK Thank you. What rights do we have as consumers in regards to compensation for this outage? It’s been over 12 hours now and I still have no signal on my phone.
@flipkartsupport No update, no replies, no communication whatsoever from flipkart.
@ThreeUKSupport My service has been shocking for 3 months now, in an area with 'good indoor and outdoor coverage' according to the website. But today it has hit new lows, managing a 26 mile journey with no phone signal (thank god for downloaded songs on Spotify) 👎🏻
@IndiGo6E The bag would have landed 12:30 pm today. I am waiting for a confirmation if its on the way or i need to pick it up. There is no communication.Its urgent!! #indigo6e #indigoairlines #help
It's very difficult operating without a phone, but I'm doing it. For those of you wondering why I'm not responding to your texts, it is in fact because I hate you and not because I have no phone. I kid.
@MoneySavingExp Yep, no internet this morning and slow internet now. I thought I ran out of data.
@japhun @Really_Ric @manxiouslife Exactly I have been with Three for over 8 years, and I just switched provider last week. I can no longer stand the lack of data connection in Central London. I work and commute there everyday, and always got no signal .
@EE it’s the third day this week that signal in my area is down. Can’t call you as I’ve got no signal. This needs to be sorted out. I work from home and need signal.
@BritishGas @BritishGasHelp Waiting for a plumber. Text at 1157; ‘your plumber will be with you between 12 &amp; 1215’. Get back by 1210 to find a sorry we missed you card. No phone call, no effort. AWFUL. This is bad customer service.
Drafting and sending emails when I have no internet connection🙄
@cathaypacific @americanair Just had the first leg of our 30+ hour trip cancelled for mechanical failure. No communication whatsoever from airline on next steps, new flights, hotel, etc.Now they want to downgrade us from premium economy to economy? Worst airline experience.
Ok this is a piss tale now. Over 13hrs no signal or data. 😡 #threedown
@cathaypacific @AmericanAir just had the first part of my 30+ hour flight cancelled for mechanical issues. Neither airline has been helpful at all in re-booking. No communication about flights or hotels. I have gold status with American and need to get back to the US for a weddin
@StarHubCares hi, there is no internet at my home. what is going on.this is the 2nd time already
Scolded for mobile addiction, Mumbai girl runs away to Pune; returned to parentshttps://t.co/5bhwTwKo9J
@ThreeUK This is now ridiculous. When will the network be restored? I have no signal at all and it is disrupting my work.
@ThreeUK do you have any updates on when the signal will be up and running again? No signal since 8am this morning.
my house is more boring than school rn, having no internet sucks ass
#ThreeUK would this outage affect my phone, am on holiday in Mallorca, suddenly no signal.
No Internet &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Slow internet
@ThreeUK No emails. No texts and no phone so no contact with anyone outside of my home. Hope there’s not an emergency
@MustardSeedUK @ThreeUK Absolutely, this morning I had no signal whatsoever, restarting the phone got a signal, but no data access. The last one was country wide as well, but didn’t seem to get picked up by journalists.
@mariebudgie1 I had that the other night off Sky. No Internet or land line.
@AppleSupport The message is no signal. https://t.co/bszKzmBBm3
omyghad i swear life is so different when you have no internet access
@MafuYoshida + repeated, if there was no communication they would end up choosing the wrong words at the wrong time... again.❝Wait a freaking second! That's wrong, you're wrong in 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈, you don't know what you say!❞That was not right. +
@mikeynevitt @ThreeUK @EE Good luck with them... 😂 Worst ones. No signal, no customer service, expensive tarrifs.
@ruskin147 @ThreeUK Mine was back about 9:30am in Edinburgh - way better than the last time this happened a few weeks back when I had several days of no internet. Seriously considering changing provider after two big outages.
oh no phone at 3%
@ThreeUK Can't be working that hard ive had no phone since 11pm last night luckily i have sky for wifi so glasgow is suffering aswell thats over 12 hrs ive without a signal
@Ord_Norm_Bloke Do not go with EE! I’ve got no signal half of the time and it’s so so crap with everything else and I’m paying way too much
@markcoxdavies Hmmmmm is this why I had no signal from about midnight until about 9am this morning?! I too was grumbling!!!
Well... the longer I'm with @ThreeUK the more I'm thinking I shouldn't be. I've been looking at the Samsung S10 5G and now I'm thinking I should be looking at it on @EE, better price and I've still got no signal, meaning I have had no signal for 12 hours.
@manxiouslife Maybe so but they should have been on the ball on Twitter etc to update folks.  Piss poor customer service. Of course networks can go down but they need to be on it. The internet is workable but no phone service is bad
@UK_CAA what is happening about automatic refunds for DD from Thomas Cook. No communication from you. Still owed money for a fully paid holiday. Have put a claim in. Still no communication. Some old information. Need update.
@ThreeUK what on earth is happening!? i can't make calls (no signal) and i can't get online - i'm now dependent on wifi!
Tiny delay in going live, no internet atm.https://t.co/rfpB9SGtKg#SmallStreamersConnect#SupportSmallStreamers @SupStreamers@SmallStreamersC@SmallStreamersR@SupportStreamz@SGH_RTs@TwitchTVGaming@Rev_R
@ThreeUK Nearing the end of a contract with you and whilst no 4G in area (Rural), HSDPA (3.5G) has been surprisingly good. Last few days there was no signal at all (very frustrating) until late last night. But 8/10 for overall usage. Shame there's no 4G though.
@ThreeUKSupport I’ve had no signal since last night, no idea if anyone has been trying to contact me. I’m hoping customers will be compensated for this.
This girl was gonna pay for her food with her debit card but they said the system was down, no internet. So I offered to pay for it and she goes “no it’s okay” smh women really ain’t shit lol
@ThreeUK @Fatimaxml123 Shameful response from Three - Pretending that they have had no internet access whatsoever.
@seanyturner @bonusgrooves Same here, using my mobile on Wi-Fi only. Already get no signal where I live so I hadn't actually noticed it was down!
No internet for a month was hell 😅More of the car project... The client liked it enough to expand the scope from an AR viewer to a full-on car configurator. Have to do a bit more decimation and combining materials together to make up for the extra geometry 🤞🤞 https://t.co/yIRINH1laE
That's why today my phone has not been working properly at all, no internet and bad signal all day. https://t.co/ogJu81mESr
@VeldmanHennie @FalkeSA @DornierWines @TRAILza You paid R20 to rent a tag. Results are up. No phone calls / emails received - just social media comments. For R130 you ran 10km on private land trails, had stocked refreshment station on route &amp; at finish, medal, luckydraws #gooddeal
@vumatel power back for 30 min already and no internet in Oakglen
@NBN_Australia is the most disappointing ‘service’... well maybe they tie equally with @yarratrams no communication, no service, no solution. Just pay for something you’ll never get #Melbourne #Australia #sobackward
@LizaChami OK here, no internet where we were. Home again until Friday morning when I leave until Monday again. Sorry my friend, I should have said something to you.
@ANTIKNIFEUK2019 No because there is no communication either way so nothing is working to break through that barrier
oh god theres no signal here
Well fancy that, no phone call (as promised) from @BarclaysBizChat and no call from @BarclaysUK Norwich branch.Time to take my business elsewhere. I’m a satisfied personal customer of @RevolutApp and @AmexUK, so let’s see what their business offerings are like
@ankyrea It won't purely bc there network adapter in my computer is fucked so theres no internet bdbsns gonna go plug it into Ethernet to let it save 😔
2 hour delay, no phone calls..... thanks social media.

This is unacceptable!! I had no signal since 11pm last night! I'm starting to think to look another provider @ThreeUK   #threedown
@slcmof @WBGamesMTL There is absolutely no communication with the fans. Waiting for years? Well, wait as much as you need. What prevents us from giving us an image of a logo or a game? Teaser? we have nothing. I do not understand their marketing company. irritation and nothing more...
@LunchtimeLiveNT @ciarakellydoc I know I always say this but I’m on the road today and I’m with eir and have virtually no signal in rural Ireland, disaster for radio. I’m so sorry
@ThreeUK this is ridiculous.... No signal or service for hours... 😭😭
@webafrica so you guys close my support case without a resolution, no communication, nothing. Then when I ask for a follow up as to what happened you guys just ignore me. Thanks a lot
No internet at means I’m about to milk tf out of my lunch like I work at the Zim Passport office
This is a shame but i don't get why so many customers are whinging and going on about refunds!!?? It's not as if @ThreeUK wanted this to happen,wanted for so many of us to have no signal.Go for a walk, get some fresh air,talk face to face with others😉 and before you know it 😃 https://t.co/Wfyfi8qEU4
So I'm frustrated because:- No communication from my MP- No movement on electoral reform- Piss poor rollout of legal cannabis- No serious plan to move from fossil fuels other than to move them from Alberta to elsewhere via rail or pipe- No regulation on usurious phone bills
@ThreeIreland @ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK I’m currently in The Republic of Ireland and have had no signal/data since last night. Any news on when it will return? Thank you

@Zuku_WeCare AC 173085 paid up 2 hours ago.. no internet. Is there a general problem or is system response time worse than government? And worse still your lines are unreachable. Communication is key to good customer service
@Francesthefoot Yes, plusnet contact open reach and report back. I have had no phone line or WiFi for 10 days, changing provider won't improve my situation but other providers compensation if you have no service after 2 days, but they cost more... 😂
I have no internet! Ahhh! I guess uploading my stories will have to wait until it’s fixed. Damn. Woke up at 6 for nothing. https://t.co/ZfRuQITb0B

Hopefully the internet issues will resolve in the UK and I can do Alchemy Stream today, my home internet is on @ThreeUK and there is no no internet Nationwide at the moment with this service. @ThreeUKSupport hopefully you can fix this fast!
@BAP_94Yjay Hahah ikr, I'd go with no internet too. But- not showering is fine too for me😂For 17 is the same for you. I'd choose to be able to whisper because I'm just that type of guy anyway :D
Have people really gone into meltdown because their network provider is having difficulties and they’ve got no signal?Wow life is really rough

@irbrooks1 I wouldn’t mind coming to stay with you... Daventry for a training course with no phone signal and only freeview tv is not the same. 😂
@TransferWise not recommended. Certified my docs, Accepted my bank transfer, then deactivated my account without notice and not returned my money. Only email, no phone, to inquire. Is this how you run your business? Everyone should be leery of your company.
@WadeFamoc @Really_Ric @manxiouslife Oh damn that’s disappointing. I’m currently with Virgin and when their signal is good, the speed is amazing but some areas have no signal at all which is so frustrating.
@Independent Three has been down for me ever since l started working in Hampstead.My phone has no signal 8hrs of the day
And there you go, the first major bug with #CatalinaOS: the HDMI port on the Mac mini 2018 is kapput. No signal, but OS says it's there as a display... 🤷‍♂️
#threedown I got no phone!
@Draegarth @ThreeUK I can't complain. Normally, I don't have issues.There is one place I go, around 20 days a year, where there's no signal but it's a bit out the way and there isn't much coverage from other networks either.I seldom make calls and I have a backup data plan with another network.
(Only just caught up with what I missed after no internet connection  all night 😠😠😠😠😠 )
@tescomobile Is there any reason my area has suddenly had no signal from you for about 4 days now?
@kendallrowanx I’ve got nothing no internet, no calls shite all. Hope it sorted soon man I get all my work through my phone, so when I leave the house I’m knackered.
Got a reply finally from the phone line, its because the work order had not been completed so thats shit tbh, no internet because the billing side had not been done and 3 days it took to complete what kind of service is this ?
No Internet this morning, I know who the first residential customer of #starlink is going to be, your looking at him ;-)@elonmusk
@BBCWorld Great cash-in by the Catholic church. How are Christians in remoter and poorer families going to use these? No internet or electricity. The Vatican should have given all the money used in crating these to real Christians in need.
@virginmedia Yes, no internet through either, tried rebooting but that hasn't helped.
@Tutor_Eduonix the site is down and I can't access anything. At moments like these, I wish I had the option to download my course's contents so that I could work offline. Whether I were to have no internet, or if the site was down... Any ETA of when it's back online?
@marcjones182 @ThreeUK Got texts n calls no Internet

@iamMVP @PLDT_Cares @PLDTHome what is the escalation process for customer and tech support? I asked to a speak to a supervisor and  a manager but the agent refused to escalate me. When will the "major network trouble" in Alabang be fixed? It's been 5 days of no internet and phone
operation phoneless is complete, however ...

Imagine paying £66 per month to have no signal. No network. Can’t even plan to get to work. Can’t order an Uber. I’ve been having network coverage issues for months but this takes the cake!! @ThreeUK
@elevenseshour_ @Etsy I had no internet at all yesterday as there was a fault...not good with a busy online business...double work today!
No internet atm but I am alive!!!! https://t.co/bPQZBaQJOY
So we are getting hit with a bomb cyclone as we speak! 60mph winds and no internet to boot! We will see how long we have power!
However I have noticed that nobody is actually talking about that concept. There is no communication that is going alongside these protests. I understand where they’re coming from because I’ve chosen to educate myself on it, but if people haven’t done that...

@NickCnf @Silvershill We have a moral obligation, to provide future care, for the mental or physical health they may need as a result of the public service.

If I step out today I will have no signal deep it 🤣 https://t.co/wE3ijWq3TF
@ThreeUK Intermittent implies a service that comes and goes at irregular intervals. It's been close to 11 hours of no signal now, absolute fucking joke!
@daveirl @noxiousjellyfis @sweetoblivion26 Because you get on a Bus Eireann bus in the middle of nowhere where there's no Internet for the driver's machine to connect to, the money needs to already be on the card.
@ThreeUK Don't we know it my signal was right off this morning and no Internet either hope you get it sorted
@IndiGo6E misplaces my checkin baggage. The Delhi @IndiGo6E staff misses to add the baggage to my ticket. More than 12 hrs and there is no communication made by Indigo. I keep calling and texting but no response from @IndiGo6E . #disappointed #carelessness #unsafe

@RevolutApp I can’t believe I recommended you to friends! My account being held for proof of funds, that has no phone, e mail, and requires me to provide my life story via smart phone. I’m thinking calling police is only option to release my money! I can’t even close account.

@LD_P Yessss nothing worse than having a phone stolen and then still having a two year contract to pay but no phone!
@ThreeUKSupport I’ve had little or no signal since 11am Tuesday, looked on your website to see their was a problem with a local mast and should be fixed in 5 hours. Signal had barely come back and now this? 🙄😠
@syswarren I know. So, since at home you have no internet, you have no internet at work. You got it? 😉

"Perhaps [...] we're more used to medicalized terminology for mental states, and also perhaps because we are in a time with a lot of change and uncertainty. Being able to name feelings might give some comfort and start some conversations." - @lynneguist https://t.co/bDxTMWsbIw
@EE hi 👋 I just wondering is there any issues with the network at the moment? As I literally have no signal what so ever. I’m able send this as using Tesco WiFi
@Hardywolf359 They don't care, non of them do. When O2 updated my local mast they shut the cell down for over a month. I had no phone or internet connection in office. Had to drive 3 mile up road to next cell to retrieve/send emails, phone calls. They gave me a months credit on line rental.
@Rudeboy_Rich @jcampbell_05 @BBCBenThompson @SkyBreakinNews @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport @BBCBreakfast I will never ever go back to Vodafone. I left them in 2016 after 19 years. I’d sooner use a bit of string and some cans. Their customer service was monumentally poor. 3 have been very good until recently, now lots of days with no signal, no apologies. Are they going bust?
@OliHudson1990 @DanChecklin @ThreeUK He can't. He got no internet 😂😂
@Sm0keyBearr @Martinjohnston @ThreeUK Exactly. Its been shit for weeks. I’m freelance I need to be on emails constantly, i was late for my job today because I had no signal for journey planner !

@jjfox123 @BarbaraRich_law @AlessandraAster Very quiet, minimal conversation IMO and definitely no phone calls (the latter is expressly specified). Loud conversation, laughter, playing music or videos all out IMO.
@ThreeUK You've been having these "difficulties" since yesterday.Unacceptable, absolutely no communication with your customers whatsoever.
@MoneySavingExp I constantly have no signal
@ThreeUKSupport It seems a little better now. But generally speaking, over the last month my coverage has been worse than usual. Often find myself with no signal now.
@leemel @ThreeUKSupport Minutes after I posted this, @threeuk's mobile network completely died. No internet all night until the early hours of the morning. #threedown  #threemobile #threeuk where did all the money of your profits go for the last two years. Clearly you stopped investing in London...
@ThreeUK  I seem to be the only one who got a text saying ‘expect disruption in the area...’ got to say, @ThreeUK do a brilliant job, so a few hours no Internet is no biggie #quietniceactually

@ThreeUK Any information about this outage would be great. You are very good at letting us know what you do well but when in trouble it’s radio silence. Unacceptable in this age. 10hrs no signal. #threedown https://t.co/EmnDLHHM6q
I’ve had no signal or anything for 12 hrs https://t.co/fA3ruO8fI7

@ThreeUKSupport Seriously frustrating. No internet. intermittent phone service. Customer services. Not even reachable

No phone call yet 🤔
So Three is down and my WiFi is a piece of shit soooo no internet for me

@svlaimcn @ThreeUK SAME THING W ME my data won’t work and there’s no signal
@KetagalanMedia @praimetiz Children with no internet literacy even be able to access, but hardly to avoid risks protect themselves. That requires more than high school graduated knowledge.Spreading digital literacy and skill is further important than just setting up the channels.
@ThreeUKSupport Well I won’t be upgrading at the end of the year, I get bad signal at home and almost no signal work and now this happens.
@ThreeUKSupport no signal midnight on both my phones. What is going on?

I’ve just spent 4 hours without data. I think, I hope it’s back now. I definitely couldn’t do those no internet challenges as well as I thought I could lol 💀
@ThreeUK not happy at all! No signal whatsoever, no internet at all. Wifi might be saving some of you but im a poor fucker who has my wifi with three 😭 no netflix for me this morning no nothing! #threedown bus wifi is all i have 🚍😭
@joisterconnect  it been 3 week no internet at pune kharadi shop no body is bother to come and fix despite of related calls and mails to customer care facing worst service in my life contact person aniket 9820630030 https://t.co/PhZ9HClhwt
@IsaiahXMills @JayMack3301 @gay_rural @mva1985 @ewarren Don't be obtuse, Isaiah. SOCIETY agrees what "blue" means in a given context and that verbs conjugate based on nouns not adjectives.  Without agreement there can be no communication.
Woke up to no signal, got it back and then lost it. It's just returned but I don't know how long for. This is a rollercoaster of emotions. I was not prepared. If you're reading this... stay strong... be safe #threedown
@ThreeUK some technical difficulties?More like no internet no texts no out going calls and couldn’t receive incoming calls ! Phone has been dead since 9pm last night!! Apologies will not cover this #threedown #threemobile this morning you will be losing some customers incl me 😡
@ThreeUK From about midnights I noticed my phone trying to find service, then when it reconnected my 4g was on but had no internet, how long will it be down as I’m paying money but I can even use what I’m paying for. My 4g is the only internet in the house.
@ThreeUKSupport can yous check whats happening no signal no access to the internet calls or texts my postcode is DN1 1LU
I’ve had literally no signal the whole time we’ve been in London n it’s so frustrating pls.
#threedown not only is my internet connection down but also keep losing the whole service as a whole.... I can deal with no internet while you fix this, but not being able to make or take any calls, and getting "emergency calls only" is an absolute joke 🙄😬🙅🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/75CwG1b2Gc
@ThreeUK Also, no internet service &gt; please check social media.#Potato
@MissRedRage No internet no tv that sucks I get so crazy without internet https://t.co/7PaDLTyaMt

The fact I have to commute with no internet is barbaric. You’ll be hearing from me today @ThreeUKSupport #threedown
@ThreeUKSupport And today no signal at all, or if I’m lucky occasional patches of 3G. And the support site is down too fire good measure. Seeing as I’m consistently not getting what I’m paying for, how do I go about get released from my contract? @ThreeUK @Three_Is_Broken
I’ve had no signal for hours @ThreeUK

@BBCBenThompson @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport @BBCBreakfast 3 phone lines back but still no internet or 4G. Service is internittent and i am told engineers are wirking on it. The entire betwork did fail at 2230 UTC. No known time yet for full fix. Hope that helps.

Does anyone know when the 3 network will be back up as I am unable to  call or text anyone # no signal
@RobloxianHS I wish I could play but there is no internet connection right now
I never watched the video; only saw still images But woke this morning still thinking about the Ajah lady story.If social media wasn't in existence with instant picture sharing, one would have doubted any such event happened at all. If na those old days of no phones,no internet
@BobbieJoHayley @jessbaskervil I’ve had no signal all morning but it’s back on now, is yours?xx
@ThreeUKSupport Morning! Data stopped working around 7am and whenever I try to connect to WiFi my phone tells me there's "no internet connection" despite connecting numerous times before to these networks. When can we expect it all to be sorted?🐥
@UPC_Switzerland Hi i have no internet, phone or tv connection since about 1 hour
@teelatisha All now no signal
@ThreeUK Intermittent service? I've had absolutely no signal since 11 last night in Devon. Would at least be nice to know what's causing it and when it'll be fixed
Very disappointed by @ThreeUK today.Unable to make phone calls,no internet access at all.After 4 years staying with three now it's a right time for me to move on.#threedown #ThreeUK #threenetwork
@airtelindia @Airtel_Presence Neither getting 4g nor 3g in my area even after selecting 4g manually. At times no signal at all
Anyone else in West Sussex that is with Three got no signal!? Is it a nationwide thing!? #Three #ThreeMobile #ThreeDown
Still got no signal come on @ThreeUKSupport fix it ASAP!!! 🤬 https://t.co/DbkzBOlct2
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupportThanks, no really, I really must thank you for the #timemachine back to 1983 when I had #nointernet #nophone #threedown #fail @ITCHFM @RinseFM @1Xtra @KaneFM @SelectorRadio @KissFMUK
@BBCNews it can happen. happened to me from 23:30 last night! I dont know why everyone is making such a big fuss, people just have no patience what so ever! This world is getting worse by the day. how can an #environment be saved with attitudes like this. no signal, Deal with it!
@BBCBreakfast Morning the newtwork was down from last night at 23:00 up to arround 06:00 we didnt have no signal on phone from 06:00 the signal for calling and recive phone was working but no mobile date , i was very upsed abot it do the fact we didnt know about it
@Vodacom No I have received no communication whatsoever
What's going on @ThreeUKSupport no signal all night/day
@ThreeUK It’s been going on for a month. I was Euston Station 2wks ago. I thought it was my new IPhone 11 when there was no signal at all for hours and I checked with others at the station. It only affected 3 customers. And recently hardly any signal at home either! Fix it fast 🤬
@ThreeUK enough is enough! 5 bars and no internet connection for 2 hours. https://t.co/QsUMk4XxOq
@ThreeUKSupport absolute farce this morning... phone connected to network, but no internet services at all. Therefore couldn’t load my weekly bus ticket so had to buy a single. Will you be reimbursing my fare?
Was just about to start shouting about the new #iOS13 update breaking my phone... but actually it’s @ThreeUK that’s down! Awesome 👏🏾 working from home with no phone today 🤷🏼‍♀️
@ThreeUK Extremely unhappy about this. No internet whatsoever. I hope I'm getting compensated for this!
could @Calum5SOS pls complete the mutual today?? even though I won’t know if he does since I have no internet 😭
Been at work since 8 and done nowt.  No internet 😂
@ThreeUKSupport I've been with #three for the best part of 15 years+!! I'm sick of having no signal in basements. What if I'm kidnapped, stuck in a basement &amp; can't even call for help?!! Looks like @EE or @VodafoneUK might be my best bet! #safetyfirst
@ThreeUK I have no signal whatsoever - I have had to logon to Twitter via my work laptop to check what the problem is as I haven't got access to WiFi been at work.
Got home and there is no internet connection. You know that sticker that shows that one fursona slamming his head on a desk. Thats my mood rn.
@iD_Mobile_UK NO SIGNAL THIS IS RIDICULOUS
@ThreeUK No. Internet either. So. Is that an issue too
@ThreeUK need to sort out their current network issues before bringing out 5G !! Poor signal for weeks and now no signal or data 🤬 @ThreeUKSupport any idea of when it will be back up?
@ThreeUKSupport not great not able to text, no internet connection - NOT HAPPY
@ThreeUKSupport Litterally cannot use my phone at all no signal, no data nothing
@ThreeUKSupport hmmm no signal, no data, no calls since 9pm yesterday. When will this be fixed. I hope your going to compensate for the inconvenience your network has caused.
@ThreeUK 12 hours non service. EE ship is rammed as we speak. Been a month if crappy service now. Slow speeds, no signal now this. #leavethreejoinEE
@ThreeUK Not just the UK, am in US for work and no signal or data for around 10 hours here too. I get that things go wrong every now and again, but how you deal with it is critical - no information for 9 hours is not the right way. Tell us what the problem is and when it will be fixed.
This whole morning no internet. Then they’ll come and tell me I should get a new SIM. Nah sort your crap network out
Thank you to everyone who wished me a very good birthday! Sorry i took long to reply. I had no internet yesterday:(  but thank you again everyone! https://t.co/M7kJkCtviq
Gone 10 hours without any internet thanks to @ThreeUK . I couldn’t even google “how to not have a panic attack when u have no internet”. Struggles
Finally @Airtel_Presence won the company&amp;customer battle for not providing services,i was facing NO internet issue from past 10 days,and now finally i have decided to switch to @reliancejio ,thank you my dear freind @ashishcsanghvi for your suggestion.@TRAI @airtelindia #airtel👎🏻
5.30am and no internet. Slight panic. Thought it was my router. Thought it was my iPad. Then thought it was the end of the world. Brain told me network problem, soul died. How did we ever live without the internet before???  #threedown
@DeeApple 🙈😄Honestly I’m ready to move to an island with no internet. This world ain’t for me anymore
@ThreeUKSupport Not that you need more complaints but to let you know, having the same issues up in Aberdeen too since last night. No signal at all or 3/4G. Always just says "searching" or says I'm "offline" even if there is allegedly 4G. 3 App won't work either.
No phone calls and no data! What is going on 3 mobile? 😡
@ThreeUK network used to be so good but I swear to god recently almost every week my internet goes down or I get no signal and I’m constantly having to look online to check network converage. Dunno why I pay £60+ a month for a fucking network that never works properly
@ThreeUKSupport How can we check back here with no signal?
Ha!Ten hours with no internetAs you might gather, it is back on now https://t.co/K4wlUZE8lC
#threedown tough and annoying it needs to be sorted quickly, if an operator has a global outage then this is a genuine concern far greater than no internet, I’m now more worried about my data being secure.
@BBCBenThompson @ThreeUK @BBCBreakfast No signal in Saffron Walden, Essex 😔 all friends on 3 are having issues
@JioCare I was trying to book Uber cab not there is no signal in mobile my family members were trying to call again and again but they are unable to reach me I am disconnected from whole world suddenly.

I want compensation for this. Absolutely ridiculous that I've had no phone network whilst I've been sleeping. We want compensation now. Early upgrade will only be sufficient because you've never been an issue in the past 😂🍻❤ #threedown @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport
@xcarlaxisxmex so i've read online, luckily i was sleeping and connected to wifi. not fun being on a night shift with no internet!

@ThreeUK No signal for 12 days now, ring up just keep getting lied to, hope we are getting refunded

Nice one @ThreeUK , no signal, no data, no communication. Cheers.
@ThreeUKSupport No internet from 11:30 last night as far as I can tell. I use this for my home broadband and work from home so it's a vital service.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport very annoying after 3 years of continuous contract, the service is getting worse day by day. No internet at all, used around 2GB out of 12GB last month. Currently using WiFi :(
Have no internet at my plac right now, I fucking hope it's temporary and it wasn't the drilling on the flat next door breaking some wall cable
@ThreeUKSupport No phone signal whatsoever 🤬
@oringepil Sorry, they can't - no signal...
No phone signal for an hour due to #threedown and it was the longest hour of my life. https://t.co/isvbb4TzxB
I’ve now had no signal for 9 hours 😩 @ThreeUKSupport #threedown
@ThreeUKSupport This is a total joke in this day and age. Almost 12 hours with no phone internet.
@DelboyxTweets This is how I’ve been living, they need to pattern up Kmt. No signal what so ever. https://t.co/UE35B3UVwp
@ThreeUKSupport can you please give us updates as there’s still no signal?
@MrMatRead @IWMTom @mister_surname @ThreeUKSupport Wi-Fi doesn't solve the issue of no signal to make calls and texts. And Wi-Fi is only at home. Not sure why you don't see "the issue". I'm not too bothered about the outage but I can understand it could get really inconvenient for some people.
@ThreeUK Ffs fix up I have no internet service
@ThreeUK Best network for data? I’ve had no signal since last night....
@priyasethibjp @MehboobaMufti @Shehla_Rashid @kavita_krishnan What a joke? U asking will they protest or condemn, but in reality u have cage them and no Internet. A lady protested yesterday, detained by BJP Pro. Anything happens, bjp : will so and so....! Enough of politics of insanity.
Kmt as soon as I get off this train I’ll have no signal. Stupid @ThreeUK
@ThreeUKSupport No phone service at all in all of Aberdeenshire, this is beyond a joke, what compensation will we get for the complete lack of service which you were trying to hide
@TFMRadioNews @ThreeUK i still have no signal
@SkyNews Who cares about bloody ' brexit'  because in 40 years There be no UK, no EU, no earth , due to 'climate change' there be no tube no cars no houses no internet , no people the planet the earth be a dead planet..!
@ThreeUKSupport how long do I have to cancel my SO contract? I joined 3 weeks ago but have no signal anywhere even though I work right in the city centre. I swapped for more data yet I struggle to use anything now I'm on three.
@ThreeUKSupport completely down. I started my commute from Reading to Paddington, all the way no connection, no internet. normally the train is awful for connection with @ThreeUKSupport  but today is a joke.
Digital India😂 .. what a joke.Almost zero network inside or outside the house. No internet. #Delhi @Airtel_Presence #jio @Reliancejio
Today is not my day. My phones got no internet service at all b/c the networks down, my eye and face is swollen up like a golf ball and now there’s a leak in my flat. Sighhhhhhhh
Website down. No phone or email support- even a message. Nothing. No comms....This is a fantastic example of how not to do disaster recovery.#ThreeUK https://t.co/UJKudJ2zsC
@ThreeUKSupport I use my mobile for work i work by driving aroud city unable to start .... who will cover my lost??? Can i cancel contact  without  paying  penalty?? Because you are not  good professional provider without any notice No internet ....
Knbs should pay the enumerators who worked tirelessly in the just concluded census. In Bomet we're in total darkness. No one understands what's going on. No communication from the relevant offices @KNBS
@ThreeUK what's happening! No internet cant make calls, tried your online network issues apparently your doing work! Really poor show, no answer when calling either. I've only got another 17 months to go with you 😥
Having no phone service after the concert was a bloody nightmare couldn’t get hold of my family to let them know I was fine and couldn’t check the bus times 🙄 @ThreeUK
Only I would get stuck on the Eastside, by myself, at 4am , with no phone .... smh
No signal at all for hours now, website unavailable and the signal's been dodgy for months.. this isn't what we are paying for @ThreeUK
@somersetseahawk @ThreeUK 3g started working around 8:30am, but no internet access. Imagine if you had to call 999 not impressed at all. A text message to all customers would have set the right expectation. Their risk manager should get fired !! That's not how you run a business.
No signal 3 is skatty as fuck
From now on whoever I kick it with we need like a no phone policy , mfs can stare at screen in the crib
No internet.By the time you read this, your thoughts and prayers will no longer be needed.
@ThreeUK Only been with you guys less than 3 months, bloody great start!! No phone when working night shift doesn't help if family need me..sort this ASAP!!!!
3 has got to be the worst network!! No signal or 3G since 10oclock last night😡😡😡 #threedown
@VodafoneUK still no internet connection- been 1 week now!
@HowdenJohn Yep.  No phone or 4G service at all
@ThreeUK Not even answering any calls!!! I have no signal at all no voice, no text and no data and it’s not intermittent there’s nothing at all
Ap 🤝 jongensNo communication skills
Whenever you guys talk about eating snacks in bed that’s all I picture. No TV on, no music, no books, no phone.Just you, snacks, and munching sounds.
@emmaxlouise___ Ahhhh so this is why I’m getting the no internet notice on my phone....boss. It’d just done another update as well 😑
@ThreeUKSupport does sending text messages using WiFi still work as it normally would when youve no signal?
@ThreeUKSupport I’ve got no internet since half past ten. So annoying. It is very unlike @ThreeUK #ThreeUK #threedown
@ThreeUKSupport can you assist with the 4g issue i have. No internet atall? https://t.co/3VWkzixGKF
Once I leave yard, no internet until I get to uni 🥴
@Rchaud1 @ThreeUK No internet? Really? In 2019 and you can’t get onto the internet? Pubs, hotels, Starbucks, Costa, loads of places you could take advantage of free Wi-Fi . Unless you have a home based Ethernet only PC,but then you wouldn’t be using three would you ?
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport no signal/data all the way from Crawley to Croydon! When's this going to be fixed? It's clear it's not specific areas and it's you're entire network!
@ThreeUKSupport When is this going to be fixed? I’m in Oz. Bit me and my wife (maybe both not 3 for long) no signal all day. No nav. No way to call home without stopping at McDonald’s WiFi. First denying an issue then accepting there is an issue but with no timescale. #uselessthreenetwork
@ACTFibernet No Internet since 24 hours. Registered a complaint but nobody response from your side. 😒😒😒
@VodafoneUK So I’ve been stressed thinking my phone had been hacked, no signal. Reset my phone to factory settings. All the stress of setting up all my online banking apps and security. Not being able to contact my kids whilst away in Spain and you feel £5 is adequate?
@ThreeUKSupport Hi Three, no signal in North Lincolnshire, come on get on it.
More @ThreeUKSupport problems! Kind of getting used to it now. No internet signal since before midnight! @Three_Is_Broken #5gFailhttps://t.co/31AiP4DVnp
@ThreeUK I think more than an apology you should start improving your services...the intermittent service have been for a while and now suddenly no internet and no connection!! Neither in others cheap countries this happen!!
No signal for voice or data from 5 am this morning??? What’s happening at three??? @ThreeUKSupport
What the hell is happening !!no phone no data.... @ThreeUK
Trying to pick up sadie from the airport with no signal is going to be fun 💀
Hey @ThreeUK &amp; @ThreeUKSupport , any reason why I either have no signal at all in central London this morning? It's been on and off all morning but off fully for the past half hour. It's kind of ridiculous.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport pathetic attempt to fix the network. 9 hours and counting. no signal, data or ability to call. disgrace
@ThreeUK No internet from yesterday 😖And when you try to ring 333 - no answer........
Have to say I laughed a bit reading the suns article this morning about @ThreeUK I am with 3 and get no signal a lot it’s a constant problem but turning my phone off and on again works 🤷🏽‍♀️ why has everyone got to “loose their minds” over it 🤣🤣
@Airtel_Presence @airtelindia Hey.. I'm travelling in Berlin, Germany. I have activated your international roaming pack. There has been no signal this morning (~2 hrs now). The Airtel app isn't helping.Can someone give an update?
Yeh literally got no signal wtf https://t.co/dw6oEgtbhs
@quizclothing @Hermesparcels How is this ‘next day delivery’? Can someone help please? No phone numbers to talk to a person and I want the goods I have paid for. https://t.co/gcJA0Iwd3V
Well it's all kicking off today isnt it. No phone signal across the UK &amp; toffs in suits being dragged off trains and kicked to within an inch of their premium bonds... it's not even 9am yet! I wonder what else the day holds....
@ThreeUK It's been troubling with trains services not working from Euston this morning and trying to figure out how to reach my destination with no internet. Well done 3
@ThreeUK Mine was down since 10 pm last night. NO CALL, NO INTERNET AND NO MESSAGES IN OR OUT. WHAT A JOKE!!!!!
@RVP2020ASAP @Boxing_Exposure Hahah If there was no internet you would be  A NOBODY.
@ThreeUK Considering I was parked on the side of the motorway last night, with no signal, no means of contacting anyone, not even 999 despite it saying emergency calls only... This is of little use to me now. Cheers!
@ThreeUK 9 hours with no signal what a joke !!!!!
So, at 6am this morning I had signal, by the time I got to work 40 minutes later, no signal. #threedown We don't have wifi at work so basically if shit goes down with the kids today I can't respond to our WhatsApp group. Hopefully no one gets punched! @ThreeUKSupport
Yeah it's a bit of a pain that @ThreeUK is down - but these things happen, no phone network is bulletproof. I'm sure it'll be okay eventually.#ThreeDown
No service and no Internet in Upper Holloway area in London for nine hour now @ThreeUKSupport 🤬
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport can we get an explanation of what's happening pls? My phone has no signal at all and I use it for work so I'm already not receiving any clients calls today which means I'm losing income. When will the network be up again pls?
@iD_Mobile_UK does your network have an issue with getting signal today? I’m in Bristol area and have no signal. Just checking it’s not my actual phone
Today there is no internet and I have computational class
@BBCBreakfast About time too. Fuming that they blame customers and our devices when it's literally everyone that can't get on, and when I did have signal (none now) there was no Internet.How they act now will decide whether I demand to leave my contract as my phone is essential as a carer.
@ThreeUK How can we check for updates when we have no internet....
No internet connection for hours. Now been knocked off network. What's going on????? @ThreeUK  #threedown
@ThreeUKSupport My phone network has been down since midnight last night,I have no signal,no internet and can't top up,your website says you are doing essential work,where Timbuktu?
Only me would be on the network that has went down x no phone for me today lol x
@ThreeUK No phone working at all since yesterday , presumably all our bills  will be adjusted accordingly ?  Tried contacting you via your website but it’s not working
@Zuku_WeCare I have given up. Now my decoder has been saying no signal for a week after some rain. Ata kama nimejipeana aje siwezi. This relationship has become abusive and exploitative. :-(
@Mama_Crocker_ I mean I’m not denying it’s not ideal, that’s for sure, but people are complaining at no signal at 1am...Unless it’s an emergency or you work nights, you don’t need your phone at 1am 😂
@iD_Mobile_UK @ThreeUK Just to clarify: I have phone service and my phone can even 'see' 4G, but it can't connect to 4G so no internet. Phone calls and SMS are working.
lool the whole three network is down ffs, no internet all day
@ThreeUKSupport any idea when the network will be up again? No internet since late last night
@ThreeUKSupport No signal AGAIN. This is now a CONSTANT. What am I paying for exactly??
@ThreeUKSupport why do I have no signal or mobile data whatsoever??? Pls sort this ASAP
@ThreeUK my three networks stop working last night 12pm no signal no internet please check and find out what happened to network thanks
@UK_CAA Are automatic refunds still taking place havent had anything,no communication either?
@ThreeUKSupport why have I no signal or internet !?
@BBCBreakfast I'm on ID mobile which runs off Three and no mobile data here too. I have been able to send a text but that is intermittent. It goes between no signal and emergency calls only.  I'm in Sheffield.
Having no internet on #threemobile right before my 4 1/2 hour train ride is dull. #threedown
@LeeCha_Mia @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport This morning I’m using southern eastern WiFi. I’ve had no internet since I left my house.

Am I the only 3 customer with no signal right now ??
@ThreeUK No signal at all in York, this is costing my business money
Ok so now this morning I’ve had NO SIGNAL! 😡 I’m having to use the WiFi on the train just to tweet to you. Ive tried everything and still no internet. What a joke.
The bad news is we had no hot water this morning and I have no phone service, but the good news is the ticket man only charged me for a child ticket so that kinda makes up for it 🤷🏻‍♀️
Come on @ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK sort it out. Got no internet and there was no warning so what's the crack?
My computer says no internet. My modem says all is good..... https://t.co/mghySQGRk9
@ThreeUKSupport I'm having to use a phone on Tesco as a WiFi hot-spot just to post this. I need my phone at the moment and am not happy as it's a lifeline as I'm a carer. I can't be stuck without it. No signal since after 11 last night.
@ThreeUK @Behzinga @_JackFowler_ @WesNelsonUk @NicolaAdamsOBE @CallofDutyUK No internet in Leicester. What is going on @ThreeUKSupport  @ThreeUK
@ThreeUK from Farringdon all the way to Old street no service. At some point i had no signal bars and it was showing: No Service @Three_Is_Broken https://t.co/rITzX8IsxQ
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport Why is there no update on why peoples phones have no signal and no Internet!? Its not just one or two phones now... IT'S EVERYWHERE.
I guess everyone is having problems with @ThreeUK network?! I have no internet on my phone! 😭 @ThreeUKSupport
@ANGERrei Face of man with no internet.Nahh but you look nice dude!
@ThreeUKSupport southampton / hedge endno internet since midnightI just back home and I use wi-fi
@ThreeUKSupport sick of this now. Only just got signal back after almost a month with nothing. Wake up to this and no signal again! It’s appalling service. @Three_Is_Broken https://t.co/g9PqtIpUfn
@ThreeUKSupport I cant make my phone connect to Three at all, no phone signal no data. Do you have any issues in London today? Thanks
@ThreeUKSupport @harj_jhutie No signal along Thames Valley/M4 from West Berskshire to M25
@NathanTrout @ThreeUK Yeah, even when they are "working" they seem to be getting worse, poor or no internet despite strong 4G signal.
thank you everyone who DMed me. not to worry. i don’t have internet at my house cause i live literally on the water and no phone for the moment. here is the view from my dining room okay https://t.co/ra2JjP6Lt2
@ThreeUK what’s happening with your service?!? Your signal in London is always bad but today is no existent! No internet and no service at all since last evening, at least in central/east London!! 🤦‍♀️ are you going to refund your subscription costumers for the lack of service?!?🤔
Had no signal since I woke up for work this morning at 3am and still no signal now, three are shit 😊😊😊
@Hollie_Alexa Is that why I woke up with no signal?😂😂
@ThreeUKSupport What has happened to your signal? I'm in Leicester (LE19) and me and some friends have nothing, and I have friends in Hartlepool (TS25) that also have no signal? Not very happy.
@BBCBenThompson @ThreeUK @BBCBreakfast Yes that is what exactly happened to me and I'm still with no internet and it's coming up emergency calls
@BBCBenThompson just heard your report about 3 network. I had no signal when I checked earlier.  Restarted phone and signal returned immediately. @BBCBreakfast
@ThreeUK frustrating as there's no signal. Had to come home after school run to check my WhatsApp and emails as most of my work communicatiin is via them. On call with 3 support for 30 mins still waiting. Pathetic as nothing has been communicated by three
@ThreeUK this network is a joke. No signal half the time and now absolutely zero updates. #StrikeThree #ImOut
@ThreeUK what is going on I have no signal and 4G? What am I paying for my 4G has been playing up for a couple of days now #sortitout
@ThreeUK I normally have no signal at home, now I have no signal anywhere. Absolute Joke , I will be looking for a new network today, plus I can’t get through to chat or tech help support #threedown #threemobile
@ThreeUK no internet in Bexhill-On-Sea since midnight.. #threedown #ThreeUK #threenetwork
What is going on @ThreeUK ???No phone signal and no information with regards to the expected downtime.
I notice there has been no communication from @ThreeUKSupport or @ThreeUK to their customers as to why the network is down or what they are doing to resolve it?  #threedown #nocommunication
@ThreeUKSupport Literally half of Cambridge now, slow internet even when there is signal, no phone signal in most places - have not had phone signal since last night, the other "three" users I was with also had no signal (all different phones) - it is a common trend I'm seeing with you
@ThreeUKSupport So I have only 3G instead of 4G and no internet connection at all in Manchester City Centre ...  please can you help?
@ThreeUKSupport no signal what so ever, whats going on? 😬
@TheYoungFello Weird, but in a good way.  We were stoners and beer drinkers, but not because it was cool, but because we   had not cell phones, no internet, and especially no social media to tell us what was what.  They will never know that freedom.  I’m still optimistic about our future.
@ThreeUKSupport are there widespread network issues? Writing from bury/Manchester UK. Showing no signal voice or data.
@virginmedia Nope.  I've run all the tests and it says there's no issue.  I have no internet, still though.
Three has completely stopped working - my mobile dongle has no signal and my Mac says there is no “coverage’ - Reading media on phone seems that Three are in a complete mess. https://t.co/LsBSdY7Zoa
@ThreeUKSupport no signal in Central Glasgow.Any idea when this will be sorted?

To be fair, in the years I’ve been on #threemobile this rarely happens, but:1. It’s v.inconvenient if you’re not connected to WiFi all day2. Yes, some of us do need to contactable 3. 999 doesn’t work4. No communication from @ThreeUK informing us how long it will take to fix
@ThreeUKSupport my phone has no data and no signal, it's usually pretty poor coverage but its gone today.
#Threedown #threemobile #ThreeUK @BBCBreakfast No signal since 10.30pm last night near Dunstable Bedfordshire. Switched phone off all last night, dead as dodo this am, no signal at all! Come on Three communicate with long term customers, appalling service!!

What kind of customer support you provide? I am with no internet since 14th instant. I paid upfront upto March 2020 I am your customer since 2013. I demand refund of my amount so that I can migrate to another service provider. ACT acts very arrogantly. @TRAI @jagograhakjago https://t.co/H4yWu3yvEu

@virginmedia According to your app perfect! Vs reality, absolutely nothing, no phone/tv/broadband! I get there might be issues and things break but what is the point telling people to check the app for status when it's wrong? I'm not the only 1 affected - all of my area is down? https://t.co/L3DXbQmJQl

@ThreeUK Network problems not just confined to UK. I'm in the US for work and same issues, no signal or data for 8 hours or so. I accept that things go awry sometimes, but providing no update or information for your customers whatsoever is unforgivably poor service. #threedown
Oh dear @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport no internet in Stoke or Stockport. I got a signal for a few minutes whilst the train passed through Macclesfield on my morning commute, but poor show guys. #SortItOut please
This is the worst network to be a part of. All of yesterday no one in my household had signal. No internet, couldn’t make calls, nothing.We could’ve died &amp; no one would know. @Three_Is_Broken https://t.co/j6QFiovKtn
@ThreeUKSupport loss of internet connection this morning and some patches with no signal at all. Will you be posting a tweet when the issue is repaired? I hope it goes smoothly.

@ThreeUKSupport what’s going on with your network?No phone or internet.
Okay been with Three for years and never had any issues but waking up to no signal and no internet with no explanation wasn't the way I wanted my Thursday to begin #threedown
A little rant here, I have no internet connection at home since sunday and my provider @SKYserves won't bring their service team to fix the damn problem they never disclosed about, I'm so mad I'm paying my internet bills timely and this is what I get in return 🤬🤬🤬
@ThreeUK are absolute shit! No internet, unable to call and no updates from them at all!🙄 I want my money back!

@ThreeUK wanna get your shit together and fix up or what? Had no internet since half 11 last night🤪 I don’t pay u for silence x
Who's ever idea it was to allow you to download episodes to your phone on the @netflix app is a genius. Been watching all my shows on these plane rides with no internet. It's great 👌🏽
If I remember correctly, maybe 9 games. No internet access, no demo disks, retailers not getting their shipments and were so pissed they didn't restock when the original allotment sold out (if it did at all)...it was an utter disaster! Really, it's lucky we got it at all.
Over 12hrs now I've had no signal on my phone. Couldn't do my job last night and lost alot of money. No warning or even apology from 3. Shove your contract up your arse, I'm going back to EE

@ThreeUK any chance of a working network anytime soon or even an update to customers left with no signal since 10pm last night??!!
@ThreeUKSupport no internet on Portsmouth and many other areas, don’t you think it would be a good idea to announce this as a problem with a potential fix date/time.
@ThreeUKSupport any update on the technical issue/no signal!?
Morning @ThreeUK where has the network gone. We have had no signal all night and still out. Except this one min. Which is how we sent this tweet. Please let the UK know what’s happening. We can’t work without our network! #threemobile #ThreeUK    #nosignal #threeoutage
@Motor_Depot customer service from the service side is appalling at Birmingham branch. Get told they would call us when they have the turbo in. No phone call for over a month now. So called up to be told they would call back Monday still no phone call. Not happy this is ongoing.
@ThreeUKSupport I’ve literally had no signal all night and still don’t till now. I’m using WiFi to send this tweet! I’m switching networks!!

@ThreeUK I've been having trouble with my data for a while, it is not been meeting what was advertised when I signed my contract and last thing I expected was to wake up today with no signal. I'm paying for a service that your not providing!Please dont lose a customer of 6 years

No power since 10.30 AM. No communication.Expected 2 resume 2.00 PM.Delhi giving 24 hrs power with lowest tarrif. Contrary UP Govt. propose to hike tarrif with such poor quality of supplies. An example of New India. Sad @ptshrikant @myogiadityanath @PMOIndia
@ThreeUKSupport I'm sure you're already very much aware, but I struggled to get any signal at all this morning and still have no internet signal!

@suraj_vinay @bainjal @ShashiTharoor @ShaziaAttaMarri Partial cell phone service restored after 74 days that too after pakistan led world pressure. No internet service, cell phone service not fully restored. No school for kids for 75 days. No normalcy, what is endia hiding?
Over 8 hours on emergency calls only with no signal or 4g? We better be compensated for this @ThreeUK  I'm losing money.
@BBCBenThompson @ThreeUK @BBCBreakfast No internet all night and still nothing :/

And yay that I couldn't send those tweets because I suddenly had no signal, now having to use tram WiFi.
@ThreeUKSupport no signal/internet since last night, what is going on?? Not impress.
@ThreeUK couldn’t even use maps to get to university this morning... three hours of no signal. Brilliant!
@spectraloats I would but I have no internet lmao
I have no internet or mobile signal. Back to the dark ages for me. Thanks Three.
@d4rce @ThreeUK @raye @Vikkstar123 @Freestyleandrew @LivCookefs And they've got no phone number to call 24 7 in case the network goes down like last night from 12 till now at 8.
@ThreeUKSupport  what’s going on?? No signal since 11.30pm last night. Due for upgrade next month, think I know who I won’t be going with 🙄
@Jared_Greenall @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport No internet since yesterday afternoon 😱😱😱 I’m at Heathrow now and still nothing, relying on WiFi
@YODaunte I agree 100% but when it comes to medical equipment, technology these days has saved soooooo many lives in so many different ways... thats one thing ppl should be thankful for. But id so be down for a phoneless, tv-less life.
@ThreeUK six chats/ calls to you yesterday as unable to log into your updated app.  Still not able despite you sending me numerous temporary passwords. No signal either today.  Really frustrating #threemobile #ThreeUK

@ThreeUKSupport I have no signal today and no 3G internet connection - is this a unique thing or widespread? Can’t get on your website either.
@ThreeUK I have got no internet on my phone. Can you please let me know, what is happening??
@AmazonHelp As of this morning when I left for work, it was a completely blank screen with "no signal" on the TVI've left it unplugged, I'll see what it's like when I return home 👍
@ThreeUK can you let us know if here in forest Hill SE23 where we have no phone service at all, is this because of works in Hither Green and how long we’ll be affected?? Urgent please!!
No phone signal at all, extinction rebellions making commuting to the wharf near impossible. Happy Thursday everyone 😁😁
@justaddScott Yep, and also in so many areas of the country there's only 1 or 2 choices of ISP. Because there's zero competition, there's no incentive to provide quality service if someone's choice is bad internet or no internet at all. We need to break up the oligopolies.
@IrwinTessa @GMB Hopefully she’s on the tube on her way to uni with no signal &amp; will contact you soon
@Jared_Greenall @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK nothing in huddersfield. Can we have some idea ease as to what's happening? Sounds like it's been going on a while with no communication from you guys.....
@ThreeUK Is Three network down?? I have no signal at all and neither does my wife, brother, or mother!
@ThreeUK sort your shit out guys. You’re about to lose myself and my entire family as customers. Mass outages that seem to be never ending, no signal inside any buildings, and you guys have just made me late for an interview because I couldn’t check train times. Absolute disgrace
@EE is there a problem with signal around Clacton? Last 2 days I have long periods of no signal
@ThreeUKSupport No internet connectivity in IP2 at the moment &amp; your website is down for maintenance. Known issue? Fix ETA?

@ThreeUKSupport any chance of fixing or at least letting customers know what's wrong with the network? Shoddy service. On nightshift with no phone is hell.
I think the real issue is the complete radio silence for 8 hours.No communication with customers is the real problem. https://t.co/WqfIH72sFL
Back to work after almost two weeks off. No phone signal, ffs @ThreeUKSupport sort it out please. #threedown #findmewifi 🤦🏻‍♀️
@realDonaldTrump Like you have to leave a mad dog so did Pelosi have to leave you. There is no communication possible with you.
@ThreeUKSupport Have Three Fixed Wireless at my wife's flat in SE15. Woke up this morning and there is no signal for the router to connect to. It's been down for at least an hour. She has Three mobile and is only getting a 3G signal.

No signal, can't make calls or send messages since yesterday!!! How quickly is 3 going to get this sorted ??  #three

@ThreeUK  what the he’ll is going on. I’ve got 6 contracts with you and non can be used due to no signal. My boyfriend relies on his phone for work and I rely on my sons as he has disabilities. I hope your giving some compensation out as I’m paying around £200 a month to you.
@edcurwen @seanfarrington @three @BBCBenThompson Someone woke up the maintenance chap at last. To be fair, the CEO text him about it at 11pm, but the guy had no signal so...
They’re not playing with the no phone policy
Fluctuating signals + no internet for the ENTIRE morning.It’s no wonder they offer the best data plans, because you can never use it!
No internet since today morning. Been relying on wifi since. I still don’t understand why I’m with @ThreeUK
@ThreeUKSupport  no signal, link doesn’t work, what’s the contingency plan here? https://t.co/s0kgLIux3N

@ThreeUKSupport outage in Durham! Says SIM not provisioned. When will this be fixed? I have no data and no signal!
@BBCBreakfast It's annoying that theres been no communication about it, but my world isn't ending. Never had any issues with #three so far and they're bound to have technical issues at some point. By far the most pleasant staff to deal with at three, I just renewed off the back of this alone.
Paying £70 a month to three just to have no signal 🙂🤡

@Cerniuk I did this test on a Mac with no internet connection as I’d set the clock forward and didn’t want it to sync back with NTP. The reissued installers for 10.13.6 and 10.14.6 both worked fine, the ones with dying certs failed. 👍

Quoted in Newsweek about ‘nomophobia’. After complaining  here yesterday about the poor use of the word ‘theories’ in a BBC piece, I do want to point out that I didn’t ‘theorize’ about the word— I gave a rather qualified conjecture. 😉https://t.co/O7odPaTcPh

@IndiaPostOffice The postal banking will become popular only if people get services at par with nationalised bank. Gandhidham-370201 lacking in improved postal banking as NO INTERNET BANKING has been allowed and Cheque book facility has not been given to depositors. Pls improve
Does every internet company do regular “maintenance” and “updates” at 2 a.m only to leave us with no internet for an hour UNANNOUNCED (no email, no alert at all) Or is it only my shitty local company? #buckeyebroadband #getbent

@VodafoneIN Can you resolve network issues in South Mumbai. Had no network yesterday. Inspite if your team saying that enough cellsites are there for coverage but such a pathetic service that there was no signal available. Price u r paying for merging with idea.

@HelmSecure Ok, but saying you responded in 4 hours makes it sound like you attempted to resolve my problem, support did not, they simply asked for a serial number, and then another day passed with no communication. When you drop $500, and get a dead box, customers expect communication.
@TheRebelTreble @ThreeUK Maybe they have no internet connection 😂
okay but having no phone attached to me is liiiiberating
@Anna_Soubry But Look how ineffective ChangeUK became.  Better to stay and influence than to leave and become all noise and no signal.

If it isn't written by Cates the tie ins for Absolute Carnage pretty much mean nothing, it's like there is no communication between any of the writers
In an exciting turn of events, looks like I might've just bricked my phone while trying to update its OS—just in time for my trip to @baltimorecomics tomorrow. Excellent timing! Might end up rolling 90s-style at the show—that is, phoneless. (Lordy loo!)
@chrisbritt @Chime Your business practices are horrible. No phone support, no chat support, just holding people money hostage. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH CHIME!!!!!!!
No Phone Week 1. 😭  Friggin Best Buy. Called Geek Squad like hey no replacement, past the 1 or 2 days. System crashed. They can't process any orders and aren't sure when. Smh when even Geek Squad can't fix their own tech issues. 😂😭

@Chime For God’s sake people, you are aware that ANYTHING involving the internet as its framework is subject to having issues like this every so often. Absolutely NO internet related business is immune to this fact. Please try to remain calm. They are working on the issue.
Gotta love people who tell the Insurance Co they phoned you (they didn’t), told the Co they would assess the damage at 9am today (4 hours later - no sign of them &amp; no phone call). Bloody annoyed &amp; I’m really busy tomorrow. Arseholes.

@teksavvy internet sucks.Anyone with a company they like? I’m in 24-48 hour no internet jail cause I missed a month. Which I paid as soon as they emailed me and called! Yet still put me in jail.
@N40066221 @fortnite @ThreeUK I had the exact same thing, I have no internet at the moment so I use my data to play and of course.. it's down. Waited 2 days for fortnite, 3 hours to download update because of shitty data, half an hour for a little update today and now whenever 3 decides to fix up
@brianspitz @storyfireapp Any chance of bringing story fire to consoles, THAT WOULD BE LIT 🔥... mostly on Nintendo switch because there’s no internet browser. I think it would be cool to type in stories,read, and watch on the Nintendo switch.. please consider it 😞
@ThomasGordy3 @jon_prosser I agree. I know the Pixel 4 can upset some people but really that's with any phone. People complain about every change on a phone, and trust me, it's everywhere. I do believe Pixel 4 is not perfect, no phone is, and it's a great phone. Too expensive? Probably a bit, but well made
100% leaving @ThreeUK worst network, I’ve had no signal now no data for hours

@Chime @Chime Your business practices are horrible. No phone support, no chat support, just holding people money hostage. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH CHIME!!!!!!!
@IPostWTFILike Thinking about a time past when all I had in Life was an ex girlfriend, booze and a playstation. Living in a broken down share house full of alcoholics and strange usually ethnic people. Late nineties no internet and so depressing. I enjoyed the games they were brilliant.
@ATTHelp my father, he’s blind. He’s also physically handicapped and has a pacemaker (can’t use cell). Day 3 of no phone service and have spent nearly 100 hours going through the various “customer service” departments with no luck. Awful.
@Chime this such embarrassment for so called bank. You left families and people stranded without their money with no branches no communication other then a copy and paste. @orlandosentinel @CNNBusiness @WESH @WESHMeredith @TMainolfiWESH @TMainolfiWESH @MSNBC @jimcramer
@LincolnOWH What's wrong with the radio station? No signal.
@AMCHelps No communication from staff.
@Chime I'm stranded due to the fact you guys have my money hostage. No phone support not even a heads up that this was going on I found out via Twitter. I promise I'll use every social media platform to make sure no one else does Business with chime! Totally unacceptable.
Got no internet so will spazzz here

@Ladylottebot I’m in Washington DC travelling and have no network what so ever even when I try and connect to a different provider. How do I get around a city so big that I’ve never been to before with no phone signal 😩.

@DavidGParsons PC is still at the old house (literally the only thing in the old house) and I'm at the new house with no internet. So probably bed because I plan on getting up early and being productive 😆
@FLOWJamaica Might as well drop some credit too since you've been dropping calls ALL. DAY.Furthermore, as of 5:50PM today I have been unable to make or receive calls. Same thing happened on Monday. No internet at my house since Saturday either. The situation is becoming untenable.
IT IS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO PLEASE PEOPLE..COMPULSIVE PERSONALITIES...NO COMMUNICATION..IT GETS EXHAUSTING

@ThreeUK what’s going on with your network? I’m in Washington DC and having serious problems accessing the network. Trying to get around a city I’ve never visited with no phone signal is a big problem! Sort it out 3!

@Owolabi_Jr @WhatsHub_ * No communication, in the form of a cellphone or an fb? You go out, you walk around, and hope to run into people maybe. Not always effective, but it works, and hey, I'm so not immature, and not wanting to be anyone, but me. Is that simple enough for you darling?
@TMobileHelp First the cellular data stopped working and now I have no signal whatsoever. Restarted my iPhone twice but no difference.

Been phoneless for 4 months. Finally got a phone again today 🙈 it's been a good 4 months.
Christ. No phone for a couple of hours and I miss multiple insane Trump fuckeries. I can't decide whether the claim of American/Roman Empire links or the letter written by a sub-literate chimp sent to a guy about to kill loads of people due to presidential idiocy is 'best'. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
congratulations to the three network for being the biggest joke and causing a NATION WIDE outage! no signal or fuck all!
@ThreeUK is your network down as had no signal since 11.30pm

@ThreeUK no signal here in Newcastle. Cannot receive or make calls or text messages. In fact nothing network related is working. #threemobile #networkdown
@TGP_Ethan why do you get no signal in your house
Paying @ThreeUK £50 a month for no signal, quality that.
Anyone else on @ThreeUK got no signal. Nightmare.
Middle finger up to Three, shittiest phone provider EVER! How is there four bars of signal one moment and then no signal for the next 20 minutes?!!!
@ThreeUKSupport why has my home WiFi stopped working all of a sudden?! No Internet at all!! #ThreeDown
@TwitterBusiness Why am I locked out my account because some one tried to compromise it and I can’t get it back as the email connected to it is no longer valid? I have no phone data to receive a text code so Why am I screwed? Had to make an new account NOT HAPPY with lack of support.
@GothReznor Papa goth: right..., no phone text or call remember
@ThreeUK what's going on with your network? "SIM not provisioned" and no internet? I need your services to work!!!

You really didn’t know how addicted you are to your phone until you have to go 2 days with no internet 🥴
@ThreeUKSupport no signal tonight, only getting emergency calls only,
This was the ideal. But it was mostly the roundabout. There was no leader, everyone wanted to be nice. No communication strategy. That roundabout. #wcic19 https://t.co/VB2fOvIOVh
@kkristimc Well again, he has untreated mental health issues. He has no communication with his family. He needs an intervention from someone. I hope there is someone.

Three mobile is fucked. No signal, twitter says it’s not just me. Also they’ve added a random £80 charge to my account overnight and can’t help with any of this because their systems are down until 3am for maintenance #farce @ThreeUK
Anyone else on three mobile network have no signal all of a sudden? #threeuk #Liverpool
@Ellieeee___x Same in West Sussex, Three mobile, no signal
Imagine running a business BACK BACK in the day. No texting, no calling, NO INTERNET. Just straight HUSTLE on the streets. How many people would still call themselves “Entrepreneurs?”
Why do I have no signal @ThreeUKSupport 😒
@VerizonSupport How do I get help w/no picture (DVR works) &amp; landline? I have the red globe/white WiFi on router (tho phone says no internet
@ASlickDeceiver » tomorrow. [[My pupils are dilated and my voice is reduced to a hypnotizing whisper.]] You won't worry because you don't have to. There's no signal there but my father and I will take care of her. No need to ask more questions, right. . [[She nods. "I trust you, I won't »

"I was gonna say hotspot me sheesh but I got no phone" -cody lmao ffs
Anybody else on @ThreeUK got no signal?
Need a weekend in the sun + no phone
In the space of 30 minutes my phone has cut out on a call 3 times. I’ve had to switch my phone to 3G. @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport I’m tired of constantly having no signal. It’s ridiculous!
@hippxe @FLOWJamaica Restart and it should be fine. I saw no signal for bit but I’m back up now.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport  network is down in Scotland as well, what's happening? No signal &amp; no data on the phone, only getting a connection through the WiFi
Due to no internet at the city field in Gainesville, there will be no live video or stats of tonight's match against Brenau (Ga.). Sorry for the inconvenience, but stayed tuned for updates and postgame. Go Eagles!!! 🦅⚽️

@ThreeUK what's happen the network is down no internet no phone call???
Was that a bout of nomophobia, @LABeachGal1? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a fascinating idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #article thx

@KyrstinBush @JeffreeStar I know that the had no internet all week end due to fires in Cali, so things have been slow. Theyre probably shipping the boxes out individually by size
@ATrinKTVU @zaphodsbud @USGSShakeAlert @GavinNewsom @Cal_OES I lived in Santa Clara, Ca during the Loma Prieta Quake. I’ve never been so scared IN MY LIFE!  The worst part of it was the “not knowing” what was going on because we had no phone, no TV, no Radio and all we could hear were sirens all night.  Frightening!
@ThreeUKSupport come off it no signal?
The stupidity.  Europe is more racist than America.You think they have no internet? No racism in those countries nah?They probably called you a stupid N**** and laughed when you walked away. https://t.co/dDC2AMe52m
Way too much goin on today and I’m just in my room with no internet 🙃
#KidsBornAfter2000WillNeverKnow not being able to get in touch with someone because there's no phone booth around. https://t.co/hwugt4BKM6
@Tesla your customer service is terrible at best. Drop my $80k car off at 8am to have a console installed. Told they will call me and send an Uber no later than 2pm for me to pick up. No phone calls or updates all day. No way to reach anyone at center.
@Marcg306 @pshyco_panda @TheBeardstone @gojizilla29 @madebygoogle Also I literally said the iPhone has been in development since last year as it was leaked towards the end so obviously I know a phone isn’t made in a fucking day. You just think I’m an Apple fanboy and want to try and “crush” me. I owe no phone loyalty. I see the similarities.
The terrible feeling of having no internet connection.
No direct lines into the supervisor. They promise to call and they don’t. They keep me waiting on hold for over 1hr and 45mins yesterday alone. Time is money but they don’t care. I have probably spent over 10hours being passed around and still no internet setup - ouch
all day we waited and no one showed up or called, again it happened on Tuesday Oct 15th. You ask to speak to supervisors they don’t call u back you escalate it further and no one calls - Horrible Customer service and still no internet installation
@murderlexx no phone, who dis?
had no internet for the last hour and i lost my mind. but im fine :p
@Chime Glad I didn't have to pay bills today. Although I couldn't really do anything else either. You guys need to give some kind of credit for this outage.Not only that but no one can get in contact with customer service and there has been no communication outside of Twitter. Wth guys
@Rikostoryy Fuck yes if I’m home during the day no signal but at night it’s good 😑😑😑
My long charger and my case made it but still no phone 🙄 if Verizon don’t send me my shittt 🙄

@156Sharknose Loved Lurgan Park with Group A, can't even imagine with Group B!I was telling my friend about Lurgan last week on the rally GB (as he was getting no signal in sweet lamb) about how they handed around the printouts of the stage times and it was the height of communications :)
I honestly just want to disappear to a far far away place no phones, no human contact, no internet. Just me.

@LeNorthSnobby @YankeeSopranooo @debow316 @mklein176 Certainly doesn’t help with the emergence of the smartphone. Growing up in the 2000s Yankee Stadium was so damn deafening no matter what time of year. Part of it certainly was because everyone was into the game. No surfing the internet, no social media, no phone games, etc.
Still no internet!!!
I remember working and being into my music and the internet cut off. Supervisor came and asked me if my computer was up and the nigga jumped out of me. I said “I ain’t got no internet right now”
My son was bad at school his mom text me talking about no phone no tv.. this nigga ain’t going for that 🤣

So I've driven to Quirindi to get service. Currently still have no power, no phone service and no coffee in Werris Creek. No idea when any services will be back :-(
I filed a request for refund with @united for the exact amount of the seat upgrades when I returned. After a lengthy wait, with no communication about anything other than that the request had been received, I contacted them again to learn my request had been denied./5

#ProTip for any #writers out there. When building a computer, choose a motherboard without any built-in wireless communication. Get USB Wifi and Bluetooth dongles for that.When it's time to write, take them out and set them aside.No internet, no distractions. Just write.
@googlemaps you need to add an ‘Avoid tunnels’ option. Especially when in a foreign country - tunnels become a huge issue with no phone service and can cause you to easily get way off track. https://t.co/QKAqOdT4FG

@lebara hey guys.Looking at contracts for elderly relative. He’s on PAYG atm but as he uses phone so infrequently he’s in danger of it automatic cutting him off. Do your contracts (cheapest sim only) have a non-use cut off time? Or will it just continue to work with no phone use?

@HoarseWisperer Trump's insane presser, letter to Erdogan and cuss out of Pelosi is stealing the visibility of this announcement right out from under Sanders. No signal boost will help it rise to the surface for air either.Oh well.
@Project_Veritas @CNN Why does Biden mention the 17th. Trump will be in Dallas Texas on the 17th for his rally! Are they planning an event and Biden just slipped? Do we really believe that Biden has no communication with the Renegade. Biden is the dam! If he falls they all follow! Too much to loose!

@ragnarock4455 @Chitoseofficial Got you beat. Back in 1994 or so, when I first played FF6 on SNES I heard there was an online fan site where you could talk about the game. I had NO internet then. Keep in mind, there was no Twitter, Facebook, or anything back then. I wanted to be online and talk to fans so much.

@fras99 A cage in an immigrant detainment facility for life without parole and no internet or tv
@fras99 A cage. Concrete floor. Foil blanket. Inadequate food &amp; no medical care. No phone, air conditioning, or tv. His partners in crime can be in the same cage with him, except for his kids. Keep them in separate cages in different buildings, and never tell him what's become of them.
@Vodacom And yet... no data and thus no internet... smses would not go through / took forever to do so... no / interrupted call service... and now excuses... so the proactive measures weren't so proactive. In fact, they're an outright failure. #stopmakingexcuses #startfixingtheproblems
@charliekirk11 Wasn’t hacked. The info was leaked. Seth Rich leaked the info. We all know this. No internet speed alive today could transfer those files at the speed in which they left the host to their destination. Leak, not hack.
@Wickes thank you for not turning up today between 08:00 and 18:00 with no communication or anything. When will we get notified of the delivery? 😠😠 #poorcustomerservice

@UN when you will wake up Un over 72 days of curfew in Kashmir. Total media blocked no mobiles no internet and 900,000 Indian troops deployed. Your silence mean you are the part of this crio https://t.co/PtwdNDKjPy
That’s why I’m done trying to fix relationships. I’ve always been the person to miss someone and reach out to them again  after we lost communication. But not anymore.

@Fenris198909 @bryggan22 @GhostRecon A lot of people invested in having a PS4 console, so for those with no Internet or desire to play online they are being somewhat defrauded. Why? Because the game has a solo mode. Either Sony or the games companies should be fined for making their games inaccessible to all people.
So... I am in hour 21 now of no internet.. Hows the new Fortnite Season and the Apex Event?
This is a isolated region away from all glamour and lights of the city. The spirituality felt here is on a level of its own. No internet no access to the outside world for 40 days, you spend time in the company of Mufti Mukhtaruddin Shah DB who is a reminder of our Akabir. https://t.co/vngDuecjoK

@mikealbeland We knew trickle-down was a fraud, but unless you'd been close to bankruptcy, the popular perception - no thanks to "experts" of the day - was that bankruptcies were personal failures. We weren't as quick to see corruption then, plus no internet from which to get better info.

I guess the time for lock down was 50, 60,70 years back. No mobile,no internet,no social media. It would not have been anything to chafe about and art 370 could have been abrogated in a most cordial manner.

No internet, no messages, no calls.  #iPhone #iphone4 #iPh https://t.co/S5FXLI1p3Y https://t.co/lOwgDNzfYx
So, my entire village has no electricity, which means no internet to work from home, no water as it gets pumped by electricity, no food (can't get takeaway coz phone doesn't work at home and the restaurants can't cook), no tv... So, I found a  spot on the beach with internet...
#wednesdaymorning #WednesdayMotivation Well I avoided social media but still had an unproductive night. But hey sometimes you start chatting and are surprised at how quickly 7 hours just flies by. But tomorrow no Internet, mean it this time... #WednesdayWisdom #wednesdaythoughts
It’s ridiculous how productive I can be with 2 hours of early morning uninterrupted time. No slack. No phone. No emails. 💪🏼
@sssonku All the time spent with no internet is about to come to fruition. Challenge accepted
Was that a bought of nomophobia, @TopCellularDeal? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a fantastic idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #realworld
@CstZhalovaga @Windermere_VSB @VSB39 @VancouverPD There was no internet when I was in school in the early 1960s and we survived. People talked to each other, kinda a novel idea.
Being alone in a big house with no internet...in a new country...with no friends...is next level depression and anxiety
@GOtvNg I wish to know why my decoder has been showing no signal since morning.
HuhTurning it on the monitors still say no signal even with the gpu in it...

Oh guess what? Still no phone line AND only learned today that @TalkTalk  have been sending engineers to a completely different address AND the Openreach engineer who did the pole work on Monday was useless and connected the wrong wire and it honestly looks like...
Two more meetings to go to, no phone charger with me, Brexit updates to follow on Twitter and battery on 12%... https://t.co/vGuxf58bJy
Just learned that ‘Nomophobia’ means the fear of not having access to a mobile phone... geez the things people get anxiety over today *freaking out as i have low battery*.. 😂
@PsalMissF Lol l totally agree.  People like to do whatever they want like there are no consequences.  They expect everything with little to no work, and they expect understanding with no communication.  All of it amazes me but l will always do what is necessary even if others don't...
@Troubl37 mine does something equally awesome..Goes to sleep,like half a second before I sit back on itthen decides that I have no internet connection and I have to restart.
@UK_CAA Still no email or refund no communication what's so ever
I love when people tell me “they ain’t paying no fuck ass down payment” I’ll be like shit ight no pressure but you leaving the store with NO PHONE 😂😂🤣🤣

@naukarshah Only for 75 minutes? No internet?
I encountered this a few weeks ago but thought it was a glitch in my app of choice. But similar results with other apps seemed suspicious, and some digging said it's an Android issue. No phone interviews means I can't write features. And no features means half of my work, gone.
@FirstNorwich Hi Liam why are all the 23s going g out of service into the city?  No communication from your company to say why and I want a 23 not a 24, completely unacceptable

@DrSundara3 Improvement since then: no phone calls required, after looting private jets takes them to tax heavens without extradition treaties and Govt provides character certificates. Example 'Apna Mehul Bhai'.  Ms. Sitharaman trying to sell rotten apples but 'maaf karo, agey baro'. 🙏

never ever seen more pathetic network than @airtelindia @Airtel_Presence Suddenly sim stops working, no signal. Changed sim, no signal. Meanwhile @reliancejio is working with full signal. I am forced to port to other network, after 10 years. Thanks to awesome service.
Yesterday, after the early morning, I made a rule. We spent the entire day without technology. No phone, computer, tv, radio, tablet...It was probably one of the best days I've had with the kids in awhile.
@Clay_C10 this is a huge indicator of organizational dysfunction. No communication so you basically send a damn SPY in to the coaching staff.

@rahulpandita @Shehla_Rashid Outrage for no internet for 1 month &amp; scrapping of article 370, but no tweets on killing innocent people by your peaceful brothers?
Pence and Pompeo are secretly communicating with the bad guys that’s why they are there,no phone calls ,private meetings 2 on 2 only sure is an expensive phone call
Furious w/ @NETGEAR customer service. They've confirmed my cable modem is defective (only 1/10th the speed it should be), and told me the only way to get a replacement is to mail this one back, and once received, they'll send me a replacement. Meaning a week w/ no internet. WTF?
No signal!!!!!!! Positioning lost!!!!!

@ShashiTharoor @IPUparliament If it's your 'integral part' why 8million people are under continous seize. Why there is no internet in #Kashmir? It's embarrassing to call India as democratic country, it's been reduced to a hindutva fascist regime. Modi is Nazi+Cow. #shameOnTharoor

@MurrToole We really do understand how important it is to keep you connected, even though the work is over a couple of days it doesn't mean you'll have no signal during that time. Do you have WiFi at home to utilise WiFi calling? - Ann-marie
@troovus I don't understand this kind of critique.  Are you supposed to be homeless, carless, jobless, phoneless and destitute before you can have an opinion regarding the climate crisis. PS fuck the monarchy!

I have no phone

@AdobeCare @Adobe @creativecloud okay... why do I have to be connected to the internet in order to work on an Indesign doc? I’m at an eye docs for 3 hours wth no internet access and now I’m completely stuck. Whose bright idea was it to do the programs this way?!

@firefire100 What does that have to do with the price of tea in China? If someone locally made a phone I could use, I'd try to buy it.  As far as I know there are no phone manufacturers in the USA. There are tons of mom and pop shops that are getting run out of business, though.
Idk why people want to know how I’m doing with this breakup ? Like it is what it is . Only thing that hits different is when you really realize that everything was a waste of time  and the “feelings” were fake. No communication no apologies no being amicable 🤷🏾‍♀️

@RepLeeZeldin Considering about 100 years ago there was no penicillin, no air conditioning, average life expectancy around 60, no cars, no air travel, no phone and no Twitter, I’d say we’re doing pretty well.

Contrary to popular belief, the DJ originally came to prominence at a time before online streaming. The DJ would go to a party with no internet (!) &amp; play songs they felt were suitable, leaving the crowd to dance. If you didn't know a song, it was a good thing. History. https://t.co/OtW9myZPPX

I remember I had someone draw a picture for me... he required a deposit fee of 25% of the drawing’s price and I paid 50% bc I knew I’d be buying it. He was 2 weeks late getting me the picture with little to no communication. Had me chasing him so I asked for the 25% deposit back

@Bajaj_Finance It's quite hard to get in touch with you guys and someone else from same company wanted to sell insurance to me!!! Come on people, I have even sent email to speak with you guys but no communication yet.
I'm currently rewatching Death Note because it aired 10 years ago on MTV and there are some episode that I missed (had no internet at the time) but after I'm done I'll definitely look into her spinoff manga, Suzune Magica.I think Nanjolno's voice fits her a lot...

This goes for any relationship romantic, friendships, family relationships. No communication only aids in the growing of bitterness and over thinking, making a situation way worse than before. Talking things out is so therpudic and can help you and the relationship grow. https://t.co/cKSEgXZorK
@AIRTEL_KE It's been 3 days now....no communication from @AIRTEL_KE | should this be be termed as rude or poor customer service. Been calling and systems prompts to be busy. Escalated the same issue on twitter &amp; still no response. I now rest my case.
@shanedawson Oh thanks goodness!! I had to get a loaner car and then I got locked out of said car and everything was inside no phone no purse nothing it was HORRIBLE!  Then to top it off I missed the launch!!  Congrats I’m so excited for you and can’t wait for the restock!!

We lived in tattered tents without electricity and in company of snakes and scorpions with no inkling of where the next meal will come from. Our children didn't skip school and progressed.Now children in #Kashmir won't attend classes coz there is no internet. #idiots
It's a shame to hear that @Google is not launching the new #Pixel4 in India, because of some bloody sensor that can't be used in India. I have been a huge fan of Pixel phones ever since I owned one, and I must tell you no phone can beat the pure Android experience (cont..) https://t.co/0vtmNWPlvx

no communication can lead to sad things you didn’t want to happen 😓
@Airtel_Presence I don’t want to be rude here but we talk about technology and progress. However, there is no internet service in my location for last 3 days and in-fact there is no tsunami, hurricane to be reason for that, but still we are facing the issue and we don’t even know why.
@Sour_Lemonade7 Oh yes I thought this time in court it will be diff but nope😪 no trust no communication how will they even have a relationship this way🤷‍♀️

Ah. Shit. I thought a solution to the no internet thing would be a hotspot, but there's no way I can afford the 200 gigs an Average American household uses.
friends join me in becoming a recluse in the middle of the woods where none of this matters, there is no internet connection, and we can hang out merrily for the rest of our livesi know ive said this before but being online is actually slowly killing us all :’)
It’s really depressing laying in bed 38 weeks pregnant listening to love songs  with your man 1000+ miles away with no communication. Not gonna lie.
@Ask_Spectrum Sorry, but why the fuck is the internet out again!?  It was out last night and back this morning. You got to do better than this.  "No internet access" my ass.  I'm in Koreatown, the heart of the city!#spectrumoutage

@CHSommers I recall reading about the 16th century English Puritans. They were a randy lot and went at it like bunnies (not much else to do, no internet) but there was always the unspoken assumption that if a child eventuated they'd both take care of it.
@youbroadband I have no internet and u claiming something elseChor company
AT&amp;T sucks!!  No internet for the second time in 5 days. @ATT   Was off three days last time. Wonder how many days it will be off this time. And they never compensate for time down.

@PapiYanni I have random moments of like no internet it’s really weird and rare but it happens
@Alydawne915 Yeah..I'm just sick of this whole black vs white crap you hear about everyday on the internet. This is why I miss the old days of the 1980s when there was no internet and you didn't get bashed for having an opinion.
@_AlohaMrHand I remember that Catholics vs Convicts game. What a build-up with no internet. Mike Stonebreaker with the crucial fumble recovery. What a fucking game.

@jediTfup so i have nothing no phone, no ps4, no going out(i barely go out anyways)
@Zack_Pearson It is. The players aren't the problem. The US have a vast plethora of talent. The coach who is actually motivating the players and is tactically arranging them is the problem. Quite simply the US didn't want it, there was no urgency, and there was no communication or unity.
@RubinReport No signal, the debate is all noise.
@earlyamhistory @ezraklein I agree in principle. Given that he has openly discussed trying to get out of there for years, it would surprise me if there was literally no communication, but maybe. Again, not sure what you do to prevent turkey from trying to clear the area. Now we are on to sanctions.
I don’t even have a show on when I sleep I literally leave my TV on No Signal.

@aymsent98 @MRobertsQLD @JWSpry @Tony__Heller There are multiple superimposed cycles, you can see them if you do a fourier analysis of the data, interestingly if you then add those waves back together you get a smoothed version of the same graph therefore there is no signal to show anthropogenic CO2 causing any change in it.
Bathrooms with no phone signal should be illegal
NO INTERNET SERVICE! VERY POOR SERVICE!@iamMVP @PLDT_Cares

In broadcasting, there is something called "Signal to Noise Ratio." Good systems have VERY LOW noise in comparison to the SIGNAL. Reduce the noise levels in your life, so that God's signals are stronger! Example: Some parts of Facebook/Twitter are ALL NOISE, and no signal! https://t.co/zXbn3OPevE

No phone in Greendale 53129. What’s the deal?
@pachi72 @BanksCori @madebygoogle The other concern is how that refresh rate, sensors and all the new stuff will impact the battery life. The Google Assistant part destroys all. No phone got that. Provided it works consistently.
Wore the same outfit today with no communication at all, this is getting out of hand 😂 https://t.co/OCNWc7VqQF

@Murda_Tv @JoshuaBlake78 It seemed pretty stable right outside the shop... just inside was potato af. I think all that metal (roof/walls) makes it even worse. My grandma has a tin roof and she gets basically no signal inside.

@AmericanAir Never made it to front of this line after 45 minutes. Your team has been unsupportive thus far. Even an AA stewardess waiting in line was upset. No communication. Me + dozens of others boarded a flight w/o knowing if we would make our connection. 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽 https://t.co/31iJaPr2Gi

Only thing about the #fightorfright event is that there is no communication between legends. At least the ping system would make everything much easier. The shadow's do a lot of damage, yeah, but actually knowing where to meet up/defend would be awesome. @PlayApex

@ElgatoSupport Yes it showed it was connected. But the screen was black. I tried it on my bros set up then, for him there was no signal at all. He connected the HD60 S back instead and al was fine. The S+ looks great, sadly only on papers. And the 4K utility has always been bad software
No internet again, fml.Anyways just finished watching The Witch at @klownqueen's place, love happy endings. :)

@WayneSleight Bird/Magic/Jordan/Malone/etc are from a different era. Different player culture. No internet. No social media. Only mass communication option was traditional media. Nobody from pre-internet era speaks up much. Only exceptions I can think of are Bill Russell &amp; Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

@drt15 Danny, as of Weds morning, no communication or instruction from SCG Trust as to how Stadium members redeem tickets to home game on Sunday at Leichardt. Makes it difficult to organise/attend match. Can you shed any light? Thanks
@itsabelslife I stand corrected. Legit excuse. I just presumed they had made little to no communication with you. I’m sure it will end up just as you planned. Good luck 😊
Hey guy I know from the local bar scene this is for you. Just because she weighed as much as two people that don’t mean you had a threesome so STFU about it. (Message will also be delivered in person I’m no internet tough guy)
.@unitiwireless it’s been pretty hard to get hold of you guys. Our incubator has had no internet for over 24hrs because of a forced hardware upgrade that went wrong - 17 businesses down and no customer service plan in place. Poor poor form.
In Nigeria, SOME service providers expect you to understand with them (based on - you know how naija be) on their delaying your job or failure to meetup, or poor services, with preplanned excuses (No light, no internet, staff jonsing etc), which should have been added to the cost

@ThreeUKSupport hi! I upgraded in store on the 23/9 to a new @Apple iPhone but I am still waiting for the preorder to come in. It’s been over 3 weeks and my contract has now ended on this phone. This is really disappointing from 3 and Apple and there has been no communication.😪
@Paula_White It is very bad communication. With no communication there is not much we can do. Sorry but that's correct. I hate letting people down. My mom said do not worry about anyone but please tell me there is somebody worth caring for. Please

But guess who is going straight home, doing her homework, and then spending the rest of the night in her room with no phone or tablet. This is embarrassing as a parent. I didn’t raise her to act like this.
i know why she did and it's a good reason but,, the way she treated me before just made it hurt 10x worse.. no communication hurt :(
@JustinFrankMD @gtconway3d And then a quiet place to sit and tweet...that has no internet. But,goodness, he doesn't need to know this, right?

One thing I dislike about the new @PlayApex event is that once the 10-man squad  teams up. There's absolutely no communication. Which I mean makes it difficult but still would be some way to get together as a team and communicate with each other. Even if it's only pinging.
I wanna play game but I still have no Internet ;-;

@tomiahonen The rest of his life locked in a shitty Motel 6 motel room with no phone, no TV, and no visitors except the deaf hipster who delivers vegan meals (his only source of food.)
@Apple Ever since I got my iPhone 11 I have like no signal everywhere I go. Places where I used to have full bars with my 7, I now get 2 bars. Are you guys going to do something about it? I know other iPhone 11 users with the same problem.
@MotherJones Perhaps, where snow &amp; cold are, governor, dressed in shorts, undershirt, &amp; flipflops, should be released from a facility with no money, no phone, just after midnight, in order to get real life experience.

Question of the day ...... what are you wanting..... how is someone to know if no communication is between one to another to figure out what they want. You hate the person.... so be it.. can’t stand looking at them..... so be it. Just say what is in your mind to them .
My family pays money for this shit(obviously). It's unacceptable for comcast to be so bad, we have long periods of no internet at all. Believe it or not, the reason my family pays for internet is not because we want no internet
it has been a long 4 days with no internet and no debit terminal, not so good for a retail business!  Thank you for your patience!  The Shaw drop to our building was knocked down by a tree in the storm and was just repaired!  It is business as usual as of 4:30 pm!

Im enjoying being phoneless
@DbDMemes I keep getting disconnected from matches because apparently I have no internet connection when I clearly do. It’s starting to really annoy me because I keep getting derailed because of it
@CashApp Its because when it rains, it pours with this app. No phone numbers at all, so WHEN you run into an issue you're gonna have to wait.With no money.No answers.No phone # to call.But the worst is the canned emails by people who are supposed to be working together, but arent.

@pintyhet Well in BC its super against the law to use your phone while driving. So that was enough of a “no phone” rule while driving for us :D
@glitchritual @LockeTribal ALSO A THOUGHT: are you using an adaptor or just HDMI&gt;DVI cable or little wire adaptor? Because unfortunately while DVI is capable of carrying both digital &amp; analogue, those won't convert &amp; could be why you're getting No Signal.

@jason0x21 I’m still pissed they took Navigon off the market. I need a fully featured, downloaded map app for my phone for the times I hit pockets with no signal like the area around my sons summer scout camp.
He's missing assignments and just not performing well overall. It's time for me to crack down and it's going to be harsh. No phone, no laptop, no PS4, no nice shoes or clothes, he'll have extra chores, etc. I don't want to do this but we've given him too many chances ☹️
@MissFlyByNight Look at this knucklehead — no signal.

“Poor people CAN save. No phone, no internet, no car, eat chicken pot pies, DONT GO OUTSIDE UNLESS FOR WORK, DO NOT reproduce, drink spit”
Expectation with no communication will have you put here with your feelings hurt.
@alanrew But we're seriously considering it anyway. We're starting to think that a slow internet connection might be better than no internet connection at all, which looks like it might be all that @virginmedia can offer.
@UK_CAA I was promised my direct debit payment in my bank account yesterday 14/10/19. No payment received no communication either really worried this isn’t going to be refunded. Friends who were joining us on holiday have had their refund over a week now!

@Grumpyrocker I love my 3a, but it has a problem sometimes that all the Pixels seem to have. It will say connected to WiFi, no Internet, but other devices have internet. Mine comes and goes, others have it a long while, maybe bc I change networks so often. Just had it tonight, then went away.

@advocate_jc Yes, but you have to realize that all of this is magnified now.  We have a 24 hour news cycle, social media platforms etc. that were not available in the past.  This has made everything that much worse...No social media, no internet, and news ONCE a day made it manageable.
@JonS_WF1 This is excellent. It nullifies one of the issues I have with services adopting it, but it doesn't fix the spatial locality issue (no phone battery? good luck). Postcodes get this right, but are lacking accuracy. Good solution might be a hybrid of the two. https://t.co/DnIhA9VuB0

A hunger for action leads to many an investor's downfall. Try an experiment. See if you can sit quietly in a room, just for 10 minutes. No books, no music, no phone, no computer, nothing. You might be surprised at how hard it is. Try it when the market is open

@G2GrabbZ Best rakan euw xD srsly this game was all about no communication and random moves until they remember they can group and fight as a team. Like "hey mate ! It's been so long ! "
Pt9: as if 1 phone call wud b enuf 2 get #Spectrum started on getting #Spectrum / #CharterCommunicationsInc fixing no internet instead getting calls apologizing etc and just making me more sick abot situation of #Spectrum keep my money althou no service provided.
@EmmaMattress absolutely appalling ‘customer service’. Have received no communication or response at all in under a month. I am going to return all and buy from @SimbaSleep @eve_sleep @Casper instead!
Yikes no internet or cell in most of Yosemite!
@VodafoneIreland You called me on the 8th Oct offering me a deal to switch my phone from eir. I accepted. Here we are and I still have no SIM card.  I’ve no phone as eir cut the service.  Live chat sent me to a store. They didn’t help. I called CS sat, nothing since. Please help.
@MRatedUK Cost might be low but signal isn't nearly as good as the other networks from what I hear from others. Been on EE for quite a few years myself and rarely find myself with no signal. Signal is nearly always 4G or H+ too.
After the week I’ve had.. damn laptop crashed. And I’m still phoneless so I gotta drive to Apple can’t even call.
It’s still very hard to not have you complain that no one is going to bother with your birthday cause mine is tomorrow. No phone call how Mike was nice and made you coffee and snuck a $20 behind Maria’s back as a… https://t.co/s1MpdQmNxQ
@sebaaide @BuddJenn @supergeenie No phone calls. You don't have the right to an attorney here.
@Zythen @BuddJenn No phone calls, sir. Strictly prohibited.
@AppleSupport I can’t cope with my phone not working properly. Since these new updates nothing updates my emails don’t come through notifications on social media doesn’t come though or it’s delayed. Then it says no internet connection. What’s happening?
Weekly digital challenge:1. No phone in bed                                          2.limit social media to 30 minutes total per day 3. Video streaming only once a day
In my mind, the DBG mass layoffs thing is just about the same as what they had going. Going forward, there will be little to no communication. Changes that do happen to the game will be not at all where they've needed to be and the same idiot is running development for the game
My phone please don’t do like this ooo..my back camera and flash light just stopped working and @VectorThaViper Dey share phone I Dey form big boy unto say I Dey use iPhone abeg no turn me to no phone 😭😭😭😭

Just FYI the pros/cons of committing vendor files (while working with cocoapods but applicable *mostly* generally):+ no internet needed to run/build the project+ no dependency (cocoapod) download issues - clone size- merge conflicts (when merging different pod versions)
Pt5: Knowing very well that #Spectrum 's follow thru might b questionable as 2 call notification left computer on from Noon until 6 PM wen I called 2 tell them no internet although got the call. Their resolution was to wanting 2 give me a Thurs tech visit to fix their problem
@JadeTaiXO Well Jade, I respect you so much as a business woman that I have no internet in supporting your safe business practices, since you cannot obtain insurance for the service you provide that I love to indulge in. Further more, it's not like I'm that eager to see you.

Well. In Ecuador till Saturday. What to do? What to do?A forest with no phone signal sounds nice right about now🤣
So missense mutations are under strong negative selection. But when you take variants that are common in chimps, there is no signal of selection pressure as you increase the frequency in humans.
@joelycett DPD delivery customer service is non-existent. No phone number to speak a person, just automated service. Their live chat is not an actual person either, automated again - it picks up key words from your text &amp; responds what it deems appropriately 🤷‍♀️ So frustrating
Pt4:they wud call 2 notify outage fixed. Call cam thru @ 4:30 PM but it was only 85% completed but were not ordered by #Spectrum / #CharterCommunicationsInc 2 go back &amp; fixed. instead #Spectrum was 2 call Tues AM those w/no internet following the fixing of the outage.

I’ve decided I’m going to file suit against @verizon for false advertisement and breach of contract. NOT superior coverage to any company. No signal in Concord MA center, parts of Waltham Belmont Boston &amp; more. I’ve screenshots showing locations and weak signal.
@thredUP_support @thredUP no phone support, no online chat support, email support takes 10 days, and no response on twitter.  Great company concept, but ZERO customer service. #badcustomerservice
@jupo1182 @wagon_hunter I think you are spot on, and a bad look for the refs, reminded me of the replacement refs... no communication on a scoring play.
Catfish is one of the stupidest show ever I ain’t never bout to be in no internet relationship
@taehh shutting my Wifi off at night with auto outlet timers, no phone in the bedroom, and not buying a house near an overhead power tower or a cell phone tower. etc. The latter is hard to do now.
@UK_CAA thanks to you I have now lost 2 holidays!I was due to pay my deposit with another company today they kept the price the same until today as was supposed to have automatic refund that I am eligible for! Had enough of the lies and no communication! Please sort this mess out

I always somehow end up phoneless I got the worsttttt luck w phones!
That no communication all day a turn off
@Hal_Duncan I spent half of 2004 in Australia with no phone whatsoever, and if you asked my to do it now I'd be dead in a week.
@UK_CAA I've phoned on the 13th to be told it should be in my account if paid by dd on the 14th october . I paid £5k on my holiday and I've had no contact about any of my automatic refund ,its pretty frustrating when you have a reference number but still no communication from you .
"How do they know a Shelby is here?" As he was stretching his legs, he tried to have a decent conversation with Moss. No phone calls meant he stayed quiet all day. A silent man will be a crazy man one day. Talking was vital for a human being. "Boy. People talk. One of the +

@Josh_Osgreat No internet sadly. Haven’t had it for about a year now
@LeeG810 Yes I'm glad too 😊I have a self imposed curfew of 7.30. No phone, no computer after that time.
Seems like @madebygoogle didn't fully learn their lesson with their price points. No phone is worth $1,000 and 64GB is too small. Anyone smart will wait a few months when Google struggles with sales and puts out promotions that cut the price to respectable levels. #Pixel4XL
Hey sorry I’ve had no phone :))
@MarzGurl Imagine a world where people like this have no internet access. It's a beautiful world.
#Acct111For tomorrow’s exam, you are allow to bring a four function calculator only. No advanced type is allowed. No phone is allowed in the exam room.
@bearbackvanilla @IrishRail Wow thanks, seems like we in self-driving AI train and we have lost communication to the outside world. 😉
This probably sounds silly, but there are lots of National Organization Of &lt;Specific Thing&gt; type websites on the Internet that are really hobby sites run by one person. If you have no phone number and no e-mail address, you look like one of those.

@virginmedia @Virgin_Victoria You guys definitely owe me the battle pass now for Fortnite &amp; Apex. Just spoken to one of your engineers and they said it is likely to be fixed on the 21st which is almost a week with no internet and most channels that I pay for. Even Sky wasnt that bad at fixing things 😂

@JeanetteJoy I can understand that. I get why people want them locked up, and we do have a gun safe. I mean I grew up in a different atmosphere. People beat their kids when they misbehaved and there was no internet to bully people with. Now's certainly a difficult time to grow up in.

@ATTBusinessCare why does it take 5 days for my company to be with out fiber &amp; voiceover for our phone and intervener. We can not function and no one cares! Multiple tickets in no phone calls returned ! We spend 7k a month with you and get nothing.
@goregirlfx Yeah so like for example, I got something from northern cali no problem, but Jeffree star lost power to his warehouse and there’s no internet (a few days ago) so they couldn’t ship anything out. So now theres a backlog I’m sure they’re getting threw. I think it’s luck of the draw
See that top right corner! 4G LTE= 4 bars = no internet connection. Every other app on the phone is fine except yours.

@sidbranca Or switch to paper only for a couple days (i.e. no Internet)? I've been doing that every once in a while this Fall. You get lots done for like a day, but then you completely lose sight of "reality" (i.e. what is happening online). 🤣

@Bronze60 @yveslavoieMTL @Cloden1 @ElectionsCan_F @MarcMillerVM While I understand this and visibly would call, I can think of at least 20 people in my neighborhood who sadly cannot for various reasons do this.

This whole era dating PERIOD is a pet peeve. mfs wanna do all the shit that married couples do AS FRIENDS. It’s no communication, no accommodation, no consideration. Quick love lost, people want to walk away and not fight for eachother anymore. All a wreck. https://t.co/1ZSisn8Z1k
@ImIncorrigible @bivviboy @Windows * Clock would only show a wrong value in windows if there is no internet connection, of course. As soon as there is internet the clock value is updated within seconds.
Won’t go back and forth dissin you on no internet
@CrunkComputing They are worth it if you utilize it well. I do lots of mountain biking and swim, and needed something takes a beating during biking, and is waterproof during laps that allows for BT headset directly to watch. Turn by turn gps w/o phone is nice at times if you have no signal.
Oh no... #Internet #nottoday https://t.co/wbcfNkpfbP
@UmemeLtd 24hours of no communicationAnd you guys now just put it up now?I thought after having no power in Gulu for a month we were going to have constant supplyBut it has turned worse
Hey there @virginmedia do you have a time frame for connections to be restored in Prestwich. No internet, phone or tv is rather problematic.
So BT in their infinite wisdom but not speed have given us internet for our house move, but then disconnected it because it can't quite hit 100 meg (which I didn't mind and expressed).So we now have 0 internet whilst I await a call to confirm we have no internet.
@willsommer A deviously clever way of keeping these disinformation memes around a long time IRL. No Internet needed which will be nice for when Russia turns off our power grid &amp; disables our Internet access.
@bt_uk So yeah I made the mistake of having @bt_uk as broadband and mobile provider. My reward is to have no internet until the 28th 🤦‍♀️

@turo I have been trying to contact your support for 5 days. Your chat doesn't work. I sent you a private message. There is no phone number to call. Shouldn't be this hard to give you my business.
@wheatfrom @LoyalDefender2K @UKLabour I had no proof of address, no job, no phone number... only one bank would give me a bank account. Good old Co-op.After that I could get a job, rent a flat...I was a struggling working mum on zero hour contracts. Not always a spare £10/ £100 for ID/ passport knocking around😟

@NTSNewsDesk @NewsThisSecond No, I have not. I was told by KU Police dispatch that the evacuation order did not come from them, but from Facilities Operations. That was why there was no phone alert, only a PA system announcement in the building. That seems odd to me.
@OlisaOsega Seriously.I can't be in a relationship with someone when there's no communication.I crave attention and it comes through communication.

The idea of cloud gaming kind of makes me nervous, though. Because once the Internet goes down, no gaming. And that's literally what I do when I have no Internet (especially with me being a TV cord-cutter).
Having no phone for 3 days showed me how much peace you can have!

@vrbo Still no phone call. Renters beware  that line item “property fee” may be “accidental damage protection” required by owner.

@Hal_Duncan Last time I went camping in the boondocks during road-construction season and forgot to bring my road atlas. Had to fumble my way home with no signal, just sense of direction and vague memories of the route I had gone in the opposite direction on the way out. (Main road closed.)

@nitin_gadkari On expressways with barricades on both sides with no signal anywhere, even a vehicle at 120kmph can be controlled. The problem arises when idiots halt, jump lanes or gather in groups and drive like herd of buffaloes without leaving space for others.

@ragincrinz @GoogleStadia I really like the IDEA of stadia: it's a streaming platform and you don't need a high powered PC, because they supply everything on their end, but I'm concerned that it's all exclusive digital content, how do i access it if i have no internet, or what if stadia goes away.

"Nomophobia" is the new entrant to the Oxford English Dictionary.

@mileslunn @VoiceOfFranky @darrellbricker @RebeccaYNot @JudgeGort @markcritch @EricGrenierCBC @22_Minutes @niknanos I forget where I read this as it's a few years old now but apparently the US election miss was largely attributed to off the grid voters (no phone altogether, and limited internet for online polls). Seems reasonable to me but just my opinion that it makes sense.
Per   @NetShutdowns    here have been no internet shutdowns reported in #India since August 25, 2019. Is this correct? Great if true. India  has shut the net 77 times in 2019.
MTS: No internet no phone since Oct 1.  I have a home business.  No one even has an estimate of repair. I am told its "complicated".  One of the complicating factors is they need permission to dig from Hydro. This is quite comical as no buried lines here. what are digging for?

@miksullivan No communication is the worst. Shed the lower tier of customers, and learn to recognise the signs. Fear not a ruthless hand. The next time this customer returns, (if they do), your prices have gone up. You’re just too costly now. Recommend a competitor, &amp; smile as they leave.

@Lowes 2.  I spent countless hours waiting for appliance deliveries that never happened.  A manager lied to me, accused me of not returning a call and the delivery folks admitted that there is no communication and that the system is messed up.  Left loose hose=water everywhere.

Phantom Vibration Syndrome is the name given when someone thinks their phone is vibrating but isn’t.
@tomiahonen @KIResists No TV, no Internet,  no phone,  no Twitter, no visitors, no parole of his  1000 years in prison in isolation with Pence in the next cell with echoes of his Bible readings in the Isolation Ward.
@HathwayBrdband This is karunakar Reddy with account number 1147426710. I reported no internet connection issue. And there is no resolution even after 48 hours. Every time i call your customer care they say will resolve in 24 hours. One guy came and took away the modem.
@bt_uk appalling service from BT. Moving home in a week, but BT stopped all our services yesterday because our buyer set up services with another provider. No warning from BT, didn’t ask us, now no internet (I work from home). Refuse to reconnect, offered £20 compensation. Avoid!
@GlideStudent hello! the wifi is sort of working on my phone, but on my laptop it shows that there's no Internet connection
@virginmedia @virginmedia Shocking service , all our 27 phone lines have now been down for 8 days, we have been phoning every department with no resolution!!!! How can we run a sales organisation with no phone lines?????
@PaulMadras Sorry Virgin has been down so no telly, no internet. Thought I'd go crackers.
Its been 70 days of curfew in Kashmir, millions of people are living with no communication, the brutality of Indian govt is still going on the innocent lives of Kashmiris.#Kashmir2KhalistanMarchInGENEVA

@StarTimes_Ng you are busy updating where there is no signal on ur DTT platform. You guys remove stations without notice. If am paying #1,900 monthly n I don't av access to FOX what's d useful. More reason u guys can't compete with DSTV. You will lose more customers soonest.

Having NO Internet was the best time to grow up!

What the heck @Lenovo @Lenovo_in who ships a product after 2 months of order? You should have given me the exp date of dispatch before placing the order. There is no phone customer support to resolve. Quiet frustrating. Cancel my order without any deductions. @forum_consumer https://t.co/sGDp9Hc2su
@EBAthunder Autumn 2019 sessions are due to start this Saturday, October 19th, why there is no communication? Which location? Who's the coach? What's happening???
@BobLoukas Work in a room with no windows. No phone. Disconnected from the internet. Most programming exercises only require a book. If you need to download libraries, get them on a USB drive from another computer. Compartmentalize your work from play.
I've been in a place like this, twisting yourself into a pretzel and beyond.  It's how you become an insane person.  Like, do you have communication with these people?  You're going to relativise your behaviour to people you have no communication with and I'm off the NBA.
what if i did roblox commissions bro why do i think about this stuff when i cant even draw yet (still no phone ecks dEE-)of course ill uhh draw friends for free unless they insist on spending ro b u x  mmyesi miss you guys
@MJT1963 There are always reasons why someone may be unable to jump thru a hoop.Example person A is housebound with no internet. Maybe infirm with age. Requires help from council to go out. But council had to cancel homehelp.

@ArcherBM @Rachelle_jdh @RichSementa @marklevinshow The situation has been made a lot worse. You want our troops to do for u when there's no communication to anybody when greenlighting the Turks to attack in the first place. Are the military forces around the world supposed to have a crystal ball for your presidents stupidity?
The older I get, the more I fantasise about retreating to a log cabin somewhere out in the middle of the woods, or on top of a mountain. No Internet, phone calls or television. Just my books, thoughts and the nourishment of nature. 🔥🏞
I have to send my phone off today to recycle so I can buy a new phone (iPhone 8 because I'm poor) so I will be phoneless for two or 3 DAYS

Cool I have no internet until possibly Sunday. Good times...
@nxcare How does the bus not show up? And with no communication to all the customers? Finally, after waiting for half an hour, I was forced to call an UBER and go to the airport, fearing every moment that I will miss my flight. An absolutely ridiculous way of operating.
I actually feel European are paying more attention to #digitalwellness than our fellow American https://t.co/pyUw39KEcj
@nxcare Another A2 towards Luton came, the driver refused to help and connect with the service for A6. The services were HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING. There was absolutely no communication from National Express even on the chat. The live tracker system for the coach was not working.
@ArifCRafiq SMS/ texting services already stopped. No internet or prepaid phone service. Yesterday a group of peaceful women protesters arrested. Sect 144 in place everywhere. Security forces in every nook and corner. The kind of normalcy India loves to see in Kashmir.

I'm going to suggest you reimburse them for their stay at the hotel, the taxi, and an explanation as to why two women left stranded with no communication for 16 hours is acceptable. And this message just now will not cut it @AirbnbHelp @Airbnb https://t.co/fwOX9zuTnk

@jonaholmes48 Because this attitude allows us to drop any responsibility or take ownership for poor decisions. It allows us to become 'I' instead of 'we'. It means we have left home to live on a hill, in a desert, on an island, in an ocean with no electricity, no phone, no friends. Hmmmm!
@Pentanet_ISP Hey, I'm waiting for iiNet to send me a new modem (because they changed my billing plan) and they've given me no updates and I've had no internet for almost 3 weeks. How fast can you guys get me up and running with NBN in the 6164 area in WA?

@prowriting @TelkomZA @JoanneGJoseph Yes please. Suggestions will be welcome as since our last chat, I had no internet for 25 minutes 😐.

@NoIAmTonyGreen @CallumJones_18 @Bluestockingmum Fully charged phone is sensible, but bear in mind there will be no signal for most of the time. Too many people, so the system is overwhelmed. Contact anyone you need to contact  before you start.And download a map. GPS will still work without a data signal.
Folks I know are facing issues with calls being dropped, no signal and internet connectivity. @VodafoneIN y'all again in the process of getting acquired by @reliancejio or @airtelindia ? smh

@KKombani The advantage of rising early I believe was being productive when the markets open. Back when there was no internet or power and you needed to both produce and sell before darkness sets in. But now you can schedule an email for 5am CDT at 3am EAT

@ElgatoSupport all makes sense. SO basically, the only way my software will read the HD60S+ is if I switch the hdmi from TV into INPUT in the Capture Card and the HDMI from the XBOX to Output. However, still no signal to TV. Also, no image in Game Capture.

@planlaufterrain @MaryAnnOchota @EnvAgencyGeomat Yes...here we have at least 90% coverage of 4G+ network. You have to have be high in mountains with no clear view or in some deep forests. We are spoiled with this - my own experience from my life up in UK...no signal at all even in some big villages - outrage.

How do you go a day without communicating with your partner? No phone call, no text, no video call, not even a beep. How na?? Daily communication is one of the basic things you must do in a relationship. It shouldn’t be difficult at all.

@Travis08496538 @NaksLfcRed @Many_Faces_ @AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump Exactly what I said, America f*cked up. They had multiple scraps of information but nobody thought to investigate them. At that time the CIA only investigated oversees threats,the FBI threats at home but there was no communication or coordination between the two agencies.
When you talk to someone all day everyday, then they have no internet for a couple of days. I feel lost😭
"HAPPY PILL"No communication, but still you. ❤️

@GeorgeHallMusic The irony is that I had received no communication at all about it from the ROH, even though I bought a ticket for The Monstrous Child at the Linbury earlier this year. I kind of twigged it was on and managed to get a return a couple of days ago. It suppose it sold well.
Wow that took years to post work said no signal rights

@DoddsMaz @StefSimanowitz @chrisinsilico It's like reading the newspaper paper back when there was no internet, I didn't believe everything I read. Having people step up and tell the truth about something that is wrong should never be dismissed.

@Telstra There gave been no disruptions reported. Your staff have said the problem is at the Telstra end. We've been told there's a block on the phone that has supposedly removed four times. There's still no phone and no internet.

What a pathetic service @VodafoneIN . Several complaints and still no resolution. No wonder why people are moving to @reliancejio. Even I had to tweet this using @reliancejio network coz no internet available for @VodafoneIN  as usual. #frustrated
@XDesis Mine was just sorta dumped on me. No communication at all. Sadly that's like 80% of artists I've commissioned.
@tomiahonen Solitary confinement, no internet access, no interviews, no TV, no family visits, vegetarian diet, no soda, biographies of Obama's only
Never ordering on Menulog again. There is no way this dude just drove straight past my house with my zinger box and turned his phone off so there was no signal, then called the restaurant and told them it was "damaged"...... GET YOUR OWN FOOD BRO😡
@ItzBullzye I just think that what they're doing to "build hype" is stupid. They have no communication and won't give us any dates or times just for an act.
oml i just heard someone across the room go like"Oh my internet is disconnectinig" and i deadass was like"...Why can i still hear them if they have no internet?"
@lacuchinaNZ @its_the_swede Yeah, I'd be cool with the island house &amp; no neighbors bit... could *maybe* deal with the no internet or cell phone for a month if I had enough time to plan, though it'd be tough...but I think the no electricity might be a deal-breaker.
@GasantAbarder @DStv @DStvCare Same issue! I’ve been trying to cancel for more than a week. No option available on the online platforms &amp; when you call in to their pathetic helpline, you’re told that a “supervisor” will call you in 24hrs. No surprise ... No phone call!! 😡🤬. I’m cancelling the debit order now

@ScottMGreer You have ranted, barked, raved all day seems just to win a 2 dime bet I placed on you? 😂😂😂 you win. Now find a real job mate. We don't know who you are and we need no communication with you. Feel free to see yourself out. Don't let the door bang your nose as you leave.

@JohnLegere Because when I called T-Mobile and told them I have no signal in my office they said they can’t do anything. So I switched to Verizon who at least gives me 2 bars.

@louistmarvels It does sound like there was possibly 2 years with no communication. And they may have been brought back together or not. Maybe even when they were younger they weren’t ready for commitment and that broke them up. Most people in relationships have broke up a few time.
Do not subscribe to @TheAthletic they take your money upfront and process the payment straight away the 7-day trial is a farce and they don't give you a refund or respond back to your emails. No phone number to contact them.  AVOID!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬
Turn my phone off don’t want no phone calls .

I took a nap earlier and woke up to find that my hand had been doing that scroll-through-my-phone motion, but with no phone in it, while I was sleeping. Brb, gotta go cast my iPhone into the fires of Mount Doom.
@lstpierre @greta Imagine a Hillary Presidency with no Internet checks and balances.
@LaMasiaGrad If there's no communication and no respect, then there's no way you could have a healthy relationship with anyone, even if they are your parents. Do what's best for you, no matter how painful it might be.

@Airtel_Presence broadband not working, Wifi says No Internet, Are you advertising for JIO?
30 years of my life I lived with post cards&amp;no phone at home. Another 15 years with landline.There is a reason for mobile ban. Was being used by terrorists to plan attacks. KYC was an issue.Very easy to pontificate in comfort zone. There is a war out there against Indian Nation. https://t.co/bibKRu1HQb
@greta They act as if there is no internet
the joke is i used to share like 5gb of data across 3 people, two of whom used it regularly bc they live in an area of incredibly spotty service with almost no internet so i got my own unlimited plan that i alone use and pay for so i'm silly for turning it off like ever
Been with no phone for a couple of days now what is life 🥺🥺
@JHBWater @HermanMashaba we've had no water in Weltevredenpark since 2pm yesterday and have had no communication as to why. Typical, pathetic service once again!
@DeanBlandino Explain to us how in this day and age, no communication happens in game to inform a ref that he made a bad call and that he’s seeing something incorrectly. It’s ludicrous that the bad call against Flowers can be REPEATED at the worst possible time. How can that be Dean?

@djjohnso @Tiberionee @UncleRee1 I read a LONG article about US polling (no opinion on UK polling for me). US polls were wrong in the last election due to the inability to reach many Republican voters (no phone, no cell). Unsure if true but it makes sense given the geographic and economic vastness.
@Papapishu I worked there for 9 years. We had no phone or internet and the power went out for days. We were fine. That’s Timberline Lodge. Just go snowboard all day.
@Ask_Spectrum so what's up with no internet for 8 hours in the 90004? ETA on it being back?
@amritat @pierrefitter No phone...(This was the moment of waking up from a very vivid dream - and it could so happen)(also, one of those dreams that should become a television series)(S1 was the PM disappears for 14 hours...national crisis. Duplicate created for public...etc)
Me: (during install of my booth, walks over to A/V guy who mounted my TVs) Hey, the way you're mounting these TVs, you're breaking the heads of the HDMI cables. That's why I'm getting no signal.Him: ok, let me break 5 more cables and come to the same conclusion...#work

@scottlynch78 @DjangoWexler People gave directions. If someone was having a party at their house, they told you how to get there. Also, directions were relative. You were expected to be able to find major waypoints and they'd guide you from there. Finally, no phone to distract from your surroundings.
I'm thinking about making a new rule for myself, no phone or internet after 8 p.m. I get sucked into the social media black hole. Anyway, here is a picture of my dog, Rio, scritching his back. https://t.co/pWOPKaw7XD

@jreidfive @AskPlayStation Hi Jason, that wouldn't be a Cox issue.  If it was a Cox issue you'd have no internet connectivity at all.  You might want to try creating a new password and hitting the sign in twice to see if that works.  -Carol
@JuliusGoat I spent election week 2016 at a monastery in Big Sur. No internet. No phone. No radio or TV. I didn't know what had happened until the Saturday after. Let me tell you, best decision ever. I'll do it again next year.

@Yetanotherrando @CttlD @TheKouk Don’t mean to brag (yes I do) but I thought up the idea of airbags in 1965 - no internet &amp; didn’t know any engineers so no way to tell/ask anyone. Now we can happily make fools of ourselves with our ideas on Twitter. 😂

ok... no, communication is key‼️ if they don’t know what bothers you/makes you crazy because you choose to stay silent then that’s not a growing relationship. this whole “he should JUST know” idea is false. this expectation is unrealistic. https://t.co/NFu8PX3mbZ

Paying an obscene amount for service from @FrontierCorp- no internet, not TV when you call they tell you that your service area is experiencing downtime and there is no estimate for a resolutionMaybe I’ll open the windows and hope I can hear @MNF from like a thousand miles away
@GeoffDB How do you retaliate when you cannot fire a rocket or communicate with your Generals.  When electronics are fried, there is no communication.
A6: Our Ss are fortunate to have 1:1 Chromebooks. Assuming they are fully charged, they could do A LOT on there, even if there was....dare I say....no internet (gasp!) #tlap https://t.co/ucU4nS27Vq
Took me a long time to figure out that no communication is still a message.
@reliancejio I am happy with Jio. At my location @airtelindia  no proper network. No internet speed. @Idea  providing worst service now when they go with @VodafoneIN. Happy with 6 paisa per minute with @reliancejio .

@Ben_A_09 @tom6024 But in all seriousness, when we grew up there was no Internet, no forum lore...if you weren't part of the community, the best you could expect was to learn from repeated issues of whatever programs or Racin' Papers you got at the track.

@ChuckWendig @SplendentSweven People see a recently built house anywhere and assume there will be electricity, HVAC, modern plumbing. They only see the part that says ‘no internet’. It would be more clear if they showed a tent.

Today I spent the afternoon with my family decorating our front yard for Halloween. No phone. Just being there in the moment. Or freaking out whenever my husband went up a ladder. He does it for a living. I can’t even look when he does it.
I didn’t officiate in the nfl: but I officiated enough to know you don’t signal two different things on one play. That’s crew communication 101. Close play like that we shake heads. Shake differently and we talk. No signal. Otherwise you look foolish:

I’m also trying not to look up places I’m stuck at online bc I’m trying to relive my childhood playing this game when there was no internet &amp; I didn’t have a strat guide. I looked up one solution that ended up being really simple so I decided to try &amp; figure out the rest alone…
@TrevDon I could do it.  No internet &amp; electricity would be tough, but I still don't have a cell phone.  No neighbors would be awesome. I love to read, don't need a pet.

@iXeno Eyeview the interactions within the body as simply mindless molecules bouncing against each other. It works in a fortunate way. But there’s no communication in the literal sense. My thermostat is useful, but it’s not really thinking.

@TELUS What in the world is going on with Telus?  We had two service visits from techs last week and now have absolutely no phone service. Apparently friends and 2 doctors have left messages on answering machine but we cannot access. No phone line whatsoever.

@czechfooty Yeah, he showed who's Slavia's boss in defense at the moment...There was no communication between CBs, Simic seemed to play way too wide, almost as RB leaving massive gap in the middle...Once Hovorka, Kalas or Suchy get fit these 2 shouldn't be involved much

@FortniteBR Funny how everyone things the trailer was “Leaked”. Come on? Epic Games is brilliant. No communication just leaks.... no Ninja until Taco Tuesday. That should be the biggest hint of all.
No internet at home. Still no power. Or heat. Life is rough but still alive.

I told the nurse that it almost seems as if it just quit - on that down slope and no signal/brain was connecting and the device was on turbo with some nitro.Strange stuff and kinda hurts some too. It's not agony type pain but, annoying as hell and very uncomfortable at minimum.

@mwam1993 @CatsTalkBack1 The more bots you have, the fewer real people there are to talk to.If your friend's list is filled with bots, it makes it harder for actual conversation.Maybe the goal is to weed out real people just so there is NO communication anymore.

@Joe_Fann I heard Russell had no communication during one TD drive, and ran the show himself. so I don’t think BS is that important. 😂😂😂(kidding) as a niner fan it pains me to say that their offense has been awesome. Can’t wait for more DK metcalf involvement.
@wetspaniel What ifs are horrible seem to strike worse when you are shattered lying in bed wanting sleep so much, the thing I've just realised is you are doing thinking a lot of things I went though when I thought I was going mad, no internet then it upset me a little.

There in that moment I wondered if I dipped my head beneath the surface if I would also disappear into its darkly dreaming depths. Ha! No phone for six days and look at me waxing poetic. I should do like a TedTalk when I get back.
Bout sums them up no communication taking people’s  herd earned money for something that’s broken and not even apologising or making effort to communicate

@plusnethelp We've tried all that. The 5GHz and 2.4GHz have always been separate. The 2.4GHz is the only router within scanning distance on Channel 10. The 5GHz - when set to a unique channel - still doesn't connect. And on the rare occasion it does, there is no internet.

@Lesufi @GDE_Admissions @EducationGP Shouldn't your system have updated this information? I've been patient as your communication have always says BUT now I'm beginning to worry.

@robbiemelv Exactly! No communication.
@GaryandShannon You forget, a lot of us during the power outages had NO internet, because the power was out.  Not everyone lives near a cell tower, Shannon, and some of those were out too.
@ManUtd No communication on the mufc women's football then. Slow week, ladies win 3-0 and nothing on app or social...

@fruitie_beauty @OG_laney @CuddleSweet @Rude_Astrology He’s proven to me in other ways as well but I made it clear that if there’s no communication and lack of respect for each other wishes and boundaries then it just aint gon work.

I'm sick and tired of the service offered by our two telecommunication providers! @FLOWJamaica been giving constant issues for weeks now and the problems have intensified. There is no signal whatsoever and u cant make calls or access data. WIFI signal goes and comes. I'M TIRED!!!
@Lucas7yoshi Well if they would release it themselves there would be no reason to leak it, so...Honestly, shutting everything down for a few hours was an interesting way to build the story and hype... now that it has been 24 hours with no communication on their part it's just frustrating.
My kids are gonna learn how to live like the amish. No phone, tablet, tv, and electrvitiy in their room until they turn 30🙅🏽‍♂️

@virginmedia no internet in WV4 again, it’s a consistent problem and stopping my self employed husband working costing us income. It’s down in my mother’s road too, so not just us. No registered as a fault on service issues took either. Suggestions?!  😡
@comcast It goes out at least 3 times a week (that I’m aware of, probably more when I’m at work). I got the robo customer service to reset the router. Still no internet. I cannot work. Terrible service.
@lordiceman Yea I checked the HDCP. No luck there. Still no signal or a black screen in safe mode
Decided to spend #WorldMentalHealthDay with family back in #Romania. No internet, no pressure to perform, and not feeling bad for neglecting my emails. #Selfcare was all I needed. Back in hospital today, more understanding and ready to deliver high quality care for all. https://t.co/A0bYZl4WN2
@ndtv What a joke being played! @sagarikaghose no phone call was a torture? Was calling more important or preventing possible terror casualties? Blockage was to  prevent terror and insinuation. Country needs no enemies when its journalists are ready to lynch its gut!

@virginmedia You took £91 off me the other day and for the second time in two weeks we have no internet yet again. Utter wank.
@FAWNA_LOVE No phone and no bank card either
Solitude experiment. $10000 bucks to stay in my basement for a month. No internet or phone access. I also live in the basement too so you’ll be bunking with me. Also I don’t have a bed so you’ll have to share my sleeping bag and will have to listen to me cry myself to sleep
@BDUTT Welcome back? Friends??? Getting back post paid phones will make them forget months of lockdown, violation of their rights, broken constitutional promises? U r worst than a joke. Perhaps u should be locked down for all this while by an occupying force and no communication at all.
Man, customer service for @WindstreamBiz @WIN_Partners is truly horrible. I've been waiting on a request for two months with no communication or resolution and now I'm being told that neither of my ticket numbers belong to Windstream. I'm livid.
@Rag_Tagg Randoms in Apex are the most awful thing. No Communication, no tactics, just run and run and run, loot everything you find and then run into your enemy arms! This is not apex, this is a running-loot-to-die Simulator xD

at this point no communication from fortnite is poor. they've created intrigue and interest, but now that's quickly turning to boredom. we're a generation with a short attention span, fortnite, you're losing our attention as quick as you gained it.
See you guys in a week no phone no Xbox no vids 😕
@SkyHelpTeam I've done the checks &amp; all ok. So must be the weather. Will this be a recurring theme this coming winter? Very time it rains no signal?

@Moubayed11 Doesn’t change the fact that they’re bad in the defensive zone. Matheson backing away from the attacking puck carrier. There’s no communication out there and it’s obvious.
Having no phone case to protest my phone feels so nice but so worrying.
No internet, no tv. No end in sight. They say Thursday maybe. So I’ll be living like it’s 1975 for a bit. So weird how things change.  Back then this was normal 🤷‍♀️
@virginmedia HiNo internet againUsed the link and no faultsTurned the hub on and off.Sure it will be back at some point but it's a bit tedious
I was in the no phone zone.
@ThreeUKSupport I’ve been to branch and I’ve rung so I’m going to try this. Upgraded 2 weeks ago and still no signal, lied to when I upgraded which has cost £80 more. Call centre are useless and in branch are useless, been with 3 for 8 years and this is how you get treated...shit
@TalkTalk could you please arrange for my 89 year old Motherto get her phone line fixed please. It’s been a week, your engineers have failed to turn up again, this time to check inside. She has an emergency alarm that is connected to the phone line. ... but no phone line
@UK_CAA @_JoeMac86 Why? I DMd you got the exact same reason and got nothing but copy and paste answers and then told that you couldn’t give specifics. I’m in the exact same situation. No communication but thousands of pounds down.
@manhattanvamp Also - I don't allow myself to be on the phone in bed. Bed is for sleeping! If i want to be on the phone, I need to get out of bed. No phone in bed before or after sleeping. Most of the idling I do is on the phone, so.
Never use @Postmates. Their lack of communication is horrendous. They messed up our order by having the wrong driver pick it up. They provide no easy way to reconcile. No phone number. They just called us and said to contact basic number. No easy support.
Anecdotal and relevant quote used here for a clickbait headline but it’s had the opposite effect of people replying without bothering to read. I do still like it even though it peaked a few years ago - now it’s a dark, windy soulless maze with no phone signal #Spinningfields https://t.co/YlAql9NEC1
@KeithAkre Right? I'm just sitting here refreshing these trends seeing parent after parent asking why the company promised their kids a fun day, then broke the game entirely, with no communication to parents about if it's ever coming back. And all these marketers say "Genius!"???

@ChuckWendig I'm down for the no internet but no electricity? How am I supposed to cook food?
Currently experimenting with: no phone in bed, read kindle only before sleeping; one hour time limit per day on all time wasting apps (Eg this one) enforced via ScreenTime iOS app. So far: pretty good!
I have a new address. Comcast screwed no internet til Tuesday
@ChuckWendig I've retreated at places with no internet and loved it, but electricity is a deal breaker. I might make an exception for summer, but not for 10k.
@SheldonLiberman yes I still have this connectivity issues and get messages no internet connection and can listen to you tube    On and off  because I get messages no internet connection
@airtelindia @Airtelbroadband Simply pathetic service by #Airtelbroadband at #Magarpattacity. Although installation done no internet connection till now . Only excuses no technical solutions since yesterday. This is about my new connection. https://t.co/jBwsqM6BcQ
@Midcontinent I told you guys last time you did an update that I wanted to be emailed ahead of time and you guys told me that wouldn’t be a problem. Here I am, no internet and no information sent to me prior. Outstanding. https://t.co/OP4agQnZnu
Saw #JexiMovie great movie. Our cell phone addictions are harming us. I did not grow up with a cell phone. No internet. Real freedom. I miss those days. Now I got two cell phones. Two. Can't go anywhere without people knowing where Im  at.  Porn. Was harder to get. Woke is a joke
@CricketSupport have been losing service off and on since September 22nd. No internet, texting or calls. Except emergency only. Random times throughout the day

Now the worst part is I am facing horrible connectivity and no internet ,thanks to #Idea . I can’t make calls , signal poor ,call drop and no internet .Why should I face burn of your merger when Idea can’t improve its connectivity .@Idea @VodafoneIN @idea_cares @VodafoneProbs
@CoxHelp . As a Bourbon Street business owner it's impossible to do business with cox. If it isn't down which is at least twice a day it has no signal. Time to switch to ATT. Don't use cox business.
@TravisCravey No Internet &amp; electricity = glorious and most noble act of sacrifice on my part.
@JudiGatson This morning I literally  had a big buck fall off the railroad trussel on Gervais street in front of my car I slammed on brakes or he would have been on my hood. He broke his leg. Some guy on sidewalk saw it and got him off road alive. No photo as no phone on then
A lot of people are very rude and I don't know why...Absolutely no communication etiquette
Having some tech issues to sort out, right monitor is showing no signal active.  Will start streaming if I sort it out but right now not looking good 😔
@biggameJames_36 @CjWilson850 Like trust me the no internet etc sounds appealing but the money gotta be right
@SouthernRailUK A minute before our train is due to leave London Bridge and with everyone sat on it, it's cancelled because there's no driver available. How did it get here then? Magic? And absolutely no communication
I’m going back home. Good night. ( my home no internet )
I thought today is a good day ... I had no internet connection... I was so excited because of Super Junior’s comeback I wanted to listen to the album later but I don’t think i won’t... #sulli

I wasn’t able to take photos today due to a none mobile day! I am not sorry for that as being able to pay my respects in the old fashion no phone way was humbling. What a wonderful send off for our brother and grateful to all the public who showed their respect. #RIPPCHarper https://t.co/asleJfxNf5
@ShawInfo can you give any update when services will start to work in Portage la Prairie please?  We got power back last night but still no phone or anything. Thanks.
The answer is yes. I mean, it's $10,000, but... why no electricity? I get no internet or cell phone, but I know people who vacation and live in places so isolated, you have to take a pontoon plane to get there, and they have generators and solar panels... That just seems dumb. https://t.co/SY4x7aNCC9
Brand-new service installed in a  brand-new house with brand-new connections and brand-new modem recommended by @Xfinity, yet NO INTERNET SERVICE. That's called breach of contract, and I will pursue legal remedy.
Having no internet connection is also great for you get to have a chance to self-reflect and do other things than just checking what's up on the social media. 😉
If it had just been no phone/internet/cable/connectivity, maybe. But no electricity? Nah. Not unless you add more zeros to that $ number. https://t.co/GpheRlXDrw
@EscrimeurArgent She knew something awful had to have happened. How her daughter looked for her father but to no avail. How there was no phone calls. And then Joel was finally arrested so she couldn’t ask him what was going on.But here he was, a walking corpse. It felt like clay against her-
@ThreeUKSupport Sometimes there is no signal
So uhh I have no internet my snap isn't working someone save me
@UK_CAA so I have paid Thomas cook by direct debit , you say if that’s our method of payment we will be refunded by 14 October, still no refund !!!! , still no communication from you !!!! And People that phone you all getting different answers !!!! What’s the script here ????
41 days since ordering house move &amp; still waiting for @OpenreachHelp @SkyHelpTeam @SkyCorporate  3 appointments3 Openreach no shows23 people spoken to at Sky23 people empathy, no action Will they show up this week?No phone, no broadband, no mobile signal #poorcustomerservice
@ChuckWendig Yeah. I could deal with no internet or phone, but no electricity? Is there running water? I want to cook and like indoor plumbing. Plus, like you said, whole horror movie waiting to happen.

Yey! Got my replacement phone! Enjoyed the 3 day break of no phone but missed being connected to the world! Was like being stuck in The Circle again! #TheCircle
is it just me or i can imagine people that type double question marks (??), are the ones driving in emergency lanes, no signal when switching lanes and cut human queues. i don't know how i came up with that assumption
@UK_CAA @alexgear4 CAA are you advising people with the correct information? I was due to fly 25/09/2019 Thomas Cook package holiday paid by direct debit. 7 payments! No communication at all only what seems like empty promises from the tweet feed. Granted you are busy but...
@daniellemeiu hahaha i'll have a new one in a couple days! kinda loving the no phone life
@Reuters Crypto is no good if theres no electricity ie no internet.. cash/gold will always be the king of currencies.. has been for 5000 years..
Happy (belated cause I had no Internet) birthday Jiminie!!! 😘
@virginmedia trying to get through at customer services since 25minutes. Have no internet since two days as no engineer showed up! #wantmymoneyback #virgincustomerservicesucks
@MaxisListens no signal and data connection since 9pm!
I would absolutely stay in a cabin with electricity for lights, cooking, heating etc, even with no internet, for a month— so long as I wasn’t stuck in the middle of water. A cabin by a lake, absolutely. I love hiking. ON a lake? Fuck no.
This after the appointed contractor allegedly failed to pay them their salaries for months with no communication for work done on the construction of the Mogaladi-Phokwane road.#MakhuduthamagaMunicipality
My phone has decided to not turn on whilst im here in Dubai so im not dead to everyone worrying, no phone till im home friday though... Brilliant
Facebook messenger is garbage, everyone I’m begging please stop trying to communicate via that horrible app. It always says I have no internet even when I clearly am connected 🤷‍♀️ https://t.co/poGa8PQfRr
@virginactiveSA no communication since last message . I request that this amount be written off urgentlyPlease advise me soonest about the process as I cannot be treated like a criminal every time a walk into  a virgin active gym. Was messaged by Ayesha who never got back.
@snapchatsupport I’m trying to delete something I sent someone and it is saying no internet connection when I have connection.
@ChuckWendig Be pretty boring. You'd have to have a giant stack of books. No phone? What about emergencies? Nope.
@DrSimEvans @FintanSlye_eso ... opinion there is an issue when developers have no incentive to site their wind farms where the impact on grid resilience is minimal.The lowest costs for consumers don't come from a world where there is no signal that accounts for the impacts of intermittency.
The thing that sucks is there is basically no outlet to fight for that with @AirCanada. No phone numbers, no human contact, just emails and Twitter DMs. And no way of expediting the process. Only vague statements and a 6 week waiting process. 2/2
@TruthRaiderHQ Gold doesn't do anything useful? Well, it doesn't corrode, and it holds its value. SOMEBODY wants it, because our whole planet's been after it since Genesis 2:10. I like #Bitcoin; but it doesn't do @Jack if the system collapses. How you gonna verify transactions with no internet?
Something, something snowstorm and no phone service (pre cellphones) The kicker is that my mom's friend didn't call the police because the didn't want her daughter's boyfriend to get arrested because of some law about transporting minors across state lines
@shitbiscuit @CrisprPrivate No internet? Eghh....
@mariskreizman @Succession_HBO Gerry when she finds out no internet and tells Roman

@snapchatsupport “No internet connection”Like I have internet connection 🤡👎🏻
I keep seeing these "challenges" where you are shown an idyllic location and asked if you would live there for a period of time with no internet, or electricity, or phone after which you would be paid a large sum of money.Would you live HERE for a year for $1,000,000? https://t.co/rUXETIi0QZ
@CNN No Phone for you; you erroneously self entitled kid. They’ll be better off.
On a slow, wet day I found myself wondering, for no particular reason, how many famous people, celebrities (whatever that means) enjoyed walking/hiking. I could find no internet reference point and so decided to create one. See https://t.co/5NJ3lQOcXVAny recommendations welcome.

@KashmirLife Who is going to read it? No internet means no online applications.
@caitlin__kelly @WIRED @jeremywins @collectcartoons Convert to flip phone or no phone
@Samoth12 the reality is their premise is flawed because if you have a month of food and no electricity it means you are going to live off rice and beans, no meat or veg. They should have just said 'electricity but no internet' and that's functionally what they are going for in 2019.
@TheLocalSweden One with no internet access
I have no phone
@claresduffy @FortniteGame @Slasher @EpicGames Nah I deleted it and many more have and will as well, getting fucked around is a stupid thing to do. No communication earns no respect

@geekyranjit @YouTubeIndia First death knell has been sounded by you aptly. If @ASUSIndia has given proper update and timeline for Android 10 easily ROG 2 would have been my phone.

@Hardik_Nik Please be informed that my team contacted you on the number 882****509 and got to know that you're facing a “no signal” issue. Regarding this concern, my team requested an engineer visit on a chargeable basis but the same was denied from your end.-Sumit

@ripplescrafts We were off for 14 hours a few weeks ago - no phone, TV or broadband from Virgin Media and my mobile with EE didn't work. Had to listen to the radio in the car to make sure we hadn't had a nuclear strike or solar flare disaster. Where are we? Not Scotland - Peterborough!

@Paytmcare @Paytm It's better to stand in queue and pay the bills rather than doing from Paytm. I paid my bill on 10th oct still no confirmation..status showing as pending. There is no phone number also to call then back. Frustrating experience with paytm https://t.co/57vNXf4dlK

I need a no phone day
@GetSpectrum your company has some of the worst customer service.  Day 8 with no internet and they can't get it right.
no phone, no car. is this freedom?
@ACTFibernet No internet when there is power. No internet when there is no power. Complaint raised are closed without intimation. Bt bill reminder is accurate...
On both occasions, I was assured that someone will call me about my concern but no phone call and not even an email was sent.Why do I have to go through hurdles to cancel my account?! I did my part.
@kasqbraks hi i have no phone because my dads taking it to get fixed
@VodafoneIN Simple requirement just provide at least 50% 4G signal that can stay on my phone every time, not loosing frequently.First floor No Signal 👇👇👇 https://t.co/ikK8FO3IB3
@Coryxvx to go phoneless, i agree
@qfbpk @3Days3Nights @martingeddes @SticknTQGETHER Study for how long for breakdown and people start to go nutz has already been done.  Trying to remember but I think one of the key time frames was 72 hours if there are no communication with the outside areas or no hope.
Sick of ringing up, to be on for over an hour to be told there is nothing wrong. @TalkTalk over had no internet for over an hr. Their solution keep note of when you lose signal.😡
a vacation w a camera and no phone would do rn also.
@PokemonGoApp The sad thing is I’m gonna miss this event due to a family cruise and no internet on board 😭
@petercatonbooks @geofftech because, amongst other things, it has no phone signal, no wi-fi &amp; no TV!
@PFF_Moo @KevinColePFF @benbbaldwin Yeah, I’m not saying there’s no signal. Just that the signal we care about is indirect. A QB can make terrible reads but have god-level accuracy and complete 70% of his passes with +10% CPOE, or make god-level reads and have mediocre accuracy and complete 70% with -5% CPOE.

Wouldn't your head be wrecked if you lived on that part of the Crumlin road where theres no signal
Not only do I get to continue having no internet til tomorrow at the earliest but I've been up all night and can't sleep AND just broke off one of my acrylic nails, the middle finger no less. I can already see today is going to suck.
@MachiavelliDre forget the framed photo...why do i need a phone case with us on it. i’ll do the pictures, i’m not framing shit and i don’t want no phone case wit you on it...wthhh😭💀
@PeterSweden7 3 networks and no internet or cable news... and decency.
6 year customer, 4 days with no internet service, multiple phone calls to your tech support once I battled to get someone you outsourced overseas on the line. Your customer service is at the bottom of the barrel.  @CenturyLink
@BRAZZORZ No. Internet explorer is good
@ThreeUKSupport There are a few patches in the village that have no signal and then signal but slow data. I did get some service Saturday evening, then no service again today.
I've seen a lot of stuff posted about #Dartmoor this year. People seem to think it's some kind of playground for idiots countrywide. It's not. Get some respect for the moors. It's a dangerous place, no safer than 50 yrs ago. And your phone won't save you when there is no signal
@thehill we wish you were on an island of onewith no phone service
@TMobileHelp I live in Herndon, VA and commute everyday from Tysons Corner. Along route 7, the signal is terribly low, sometimes no signal at all. This has been an ongoing situation since I switched to TMobile in 2016. When I was with ATT, I never had signal issues.
@BDUTT First.. why the curfewThen.. why no phone linesThen.. why no mobilesNow.. why no normal politicsWhat next? Why no _______? Please fill in the blanks
@daddys_girlT Lmaooooo there's no phone. When you go he will go on his knees and beg. What we no see before😂😂
No human resources available, robotic msgs, mails , no phone call from flipkart #FlipkartFraud #kalyankrishnamurthy
Stopped to let a plummy-voiced young man use my phone - he'd been locked out of his flat with no shoes, no phone and a massive lovebite on his neck - clearly a bit of a rogue!
@silowireless is your system down?  We have no internet and I have reset everything at our end.
Just saw a tweet that said It’s not as if there were no communication in Kashmir, the landlines were still working. I so wish to take the person’s cell phone away. The extended blackout in Kashmir cannot be justified.
@sainsburys my grocery order was meant to arrive between 2-3pm and is not here. No phone call from driver to apologise or update. Please advise.
@CPPuneCity @moveinsync @supriya_mirror @timesofindia You joking right?? Lost position in ease of travel?? Was there any ever? Bad roads, no bus, train, no signal, unruly citizen.small city like Bhubaneswar has done wonders on road, transport side, which you don't have 1% of. I challenge you to name one signal i.e traffic compliant.

@GrumpRitchie Sorry Ian. Can you please expand on the service failures? Is the issue WiFi related or is there no internet signal reaching your property whatsoever? When the service is failing, what is a typical duration?  ^LS
@soledadobrien You tweet all day long...you no internet?#wokenotwoke
@StagecoachSW yet again 3.02pm from bideford is missing and no communication 😡😡🤬🤬🤬
— her soul. Hades had been nothing but respectful to her. The only thing that disturbed her was the little to no communication between them and that was killing her heart.—
@telegram I'm not able to register an account. I correctly enter my mobile number and receive no phone call or sms from telegram. Cell phone works fine, received sms and calls before and after. I have emailed telegram support 3x's in 3 days with no response.
Facebook have frozen my accountThey wanted Photo ID..which i sent via their link..They replied by email next day saying this I D was not right...so forward photo of Driving Licence...but no link to do so..theres no phone number to call...so 4 days later nothing!!Any ideas ??
No one on ANY forum is talking about @WebToDoor @sprvgroup @rodsantulan anymore 😂 Seriously, none. People have given up on $sprv. 200M+ on BID, no communication from CEO, 25+ agreeing to call Fruci daily, it goes on and on... Rod, you thief! #logistics #startup @SEC_Enforcement https://t.co/9zlpNBERgA

@HelenCycling @chrisgerhard There are no signal controlled crossings or zebra crossings on that road between Sholden Primary and Deal Station.  A big swathe of town.
@airindiain I am waiting for an update and still no response from the Bangalore baggage services.. no phone calls are being answered and no response on this tweet.. this is ridiculous
Pink laws.  No smoking in restaurants and planes.  Owing to Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, minimum age for alcohol changed to 21.  Laws requiring use of helmets and seat belts.  Also, no communication threat to wife, or girlfriend.  Pink ink essence of law book.
Hey @virginmedia you having problems in Swindon? It's like the stoneage here and difficult to get work done when there's no internet connection #freelancer
@TalkTalk The speed test is fine (slightly slower than it should be) when a device is working. But when the issue occurs the device is connected to the router, but has no internet, so I can’t run a speed test on it.
@philwoodford It's the left and right hand not knowing what they are doing. When son was sick, out of hours sent us straight to the hospital having told us they'd phoned ahead to speak to the ward. Got there, no phone call received. No clue what we were doing there. Snr Dr stepped in to fix it
Alright! I’ve got 25 people who have agreed to call Fruci and Associates daily this week! Time to recommend to them daily that they should stop working with the #fraud @rodsantulan @webtodoor @sprvgroup Stock $SPRV is a joke! 200M+ on the BID! No communication #startup #logistics
Went to bathroom, locked door, lock FELL OFF. Stuck in bathroom with no phone. Housemates just left. Only wearing a towel. Great. I escaped in under 2 minutes using a biro I found on the floor.I'm just saying, I could totally be a spy 😅
@TrevDon Can I have electricity enough for a laptop &amp; iPad (no internet) to write?If so, sign me up. 👍🏻
@htTweets No signal get
@Hollard perhaps you will respond if I tweet you! I have been waiting for 3 weeks for resolution of a claim. No communication just acknowledgement emails. Imagine if I was reliant on this money to bury my father!
@FelloWyatt Look at them, no phones, no internet. Just straight up vibing

@Eugenio_7ds @vivicarol0200 It's ok because I have no internet friends.......
Played Russian roulette with our @SkyUK contract and cancelled a month ago. Seems they can't be bothered to keep a 10yr customer on full tv/phone/broadband package and didn't even try to stop us, no phone call, nothing. Haha. Downside: recorded programs can't be accessed. :(
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends No plan... no communication... no leadership... but hey at least we know how to vote on dancing with the stars... good job
Hey is there something wrong with the internet connection today? No internet since morning. @Dhiraagu
@Ibne_Sena @JioCare @Airtel_Presence @JioCare @reliancejio @Airtel_Presence @airtelindia do something through which people in J&amp;K can recharge their numbers through calls. There's no Internet for them how will they recharge.

@UK_CAA When’s the end of today classed as for emails to be received? 4pm/5pm/7pm or are people working till midnight? I’ve still received no communication and no refund and I was paying DD instalments. Thanks.
@disruptordavies @johncurtinEA @EnvAgency @floodmary @FloodSkinner @CellAlert @floodre @DefraDigital @DaveThroupEA Cell Broadcasts would be received from another operator if yours isn't available or even if you have no signal (emergency calls only) but agree that places with no network at all prove to be a challenge for any type of mobile communications.

@virginmedia The postcode check shows no issue but, when there are two engineers (I hope) outside fiddling in the junction box and my hardware test says there’s no signal coming in I imaging it’s probably FUBAR for now. Really not ideal...
@FLOWJamaica no internet in Boscobel St Mary from Saturday this is so unacceptable. Always poor internet here
perks of having no phone is ppl always think im doing work cuz im always on my laptop but jokes on them im scrolling through twitter and responding to messages
My phone: U want app updates?Me: No.Phone: When u want em? Me: Never. Phone: It's happening lady or i shut u down.  Me: Thug. Fine. I'll do it but only when shit doesnt work correctly.

@LodurZJ @_Rades @matticus Said elsewhere, but it's not the length of the downtime that I think would upset players here, it's the silence. You really think WoW players would just accept the game going down with NO communication from Blizz for... *checks watch*... almost 20 hours?
That's exactly the problem. The HUMAN-E element is non existent. They don't realize that they're supposed to be working for the people. Not be against people. All they know us the power Trip. No communication skills whatsoever. Just a big, bad, bully with a badge and gun. Sad😞 https://t.co/bKIjAyrtT7
A day off is having no phone Ok Get that straight Zero phone - Otherwise its called working because emergency on call which is WORKING
@VodafoneUK not proactively, sorry. I've been on chats more than 5 times now (customer lines are not available from abroad, very nice touch) and all the operators are very apologetic and promesing the line will be fixed in 2 hours, but here I am 24 hours later, with £9k charges and no phone
@myntra worst experience of shopping from this site. Previously 3 products of mine were undelivered due to “wrong address” as stated by the delivery executives through SMS but no phone calls were made from their side. The same was shown as returned to the seller without any info.
@zunguzungu I just remember how trapped I felt being in Brooklyn--I was on an island, and there was no way to leave. And no internet or phones!
@tictoc India put curfew in Kashmir for the last 70 days, no food &amp; water supplies, no media, no medicine, no internet in the valley. Indian occupational forces killing innocent people.

@mark_riedl It really went off the rails for me about halfway through. Never quite understood the "no communication with the uploaded [unless you work for the other super rich guy with a god complex]" plot point either.
I love having no Internet so I can't do any of the really important work I need to do 😡😡😡😡😡
@TheeNeoK also i am phoneless at the moment so ho rough

Great story by @Maha_Shoonya here. Postpaid mobile connections are back up in #Kashmir but users are being asked to clear dues from 5 Aug-30 Sep - even though they couldn't use the phones!Plus: As there's no internet still, huge lines to get it done at recharge shops. Sigh. https://t.co/fLQAkteBpb
@virginmedia This was supposed to be a prearranged chat for 2 as discussed on earlier webchat this morning. I do have things to do with my children today and can’t do this webchat with no signal. Can this be arranged ASAP, as it is now half an hour over agreed time. Thanks

@Khanda32981538 @AshikaRaut @Greenbirds16 @hiambuj @thepeeinghuman Yes, people in various regions of Pakistan have been locked down from last 72 days. Yes, there is no communication, be it Gilgit, Balochistan or any other region. That's what you wanted to say. See what have you don't to us, then talk about Pakistan.

@geofftech When I stayed at Rannoch. No phone signal, no WiFi and no TV at Rannoch Hotel. Phone box by the station so I could ring my wife and tell her what a wonderful place it is.
SHERLOCK Her phone. Where’s her mobile phone. No phone on the body, no phone in her case. We know she has one - the number’s right there, and you just texted it.
My phone automatically updated last night and now it keeps saying “Make your Memoji!” No phone. I can’t. I have an iPhone 7. You do not have the features.

@simonahac @Progressive_Con @chay_alicia An emergency? 1.5C temp rise in 150 years. Sea levels rising .5m every 100 years. No signal of extreme weather. Climate related deaths globally at an all time low. Describing these circumstances as an "emergency" is simply not rational.

@ThreeUKSupport Is there an outage in liverpool 6 area ?Had no internet since saturday Thanks
@UK_CAA is there any way to tell me if I qualify for the automatic payment? I've checked and checked and I'm pretty sure I do, but with no communication, it's hard not to wonder about it and I'm beyond stressed. Any help or advice would be appreciated.
All the psycho fans needs to be locked somewhere with no internet access. If you hate someone, can't you just hate it quietly, do you need to be a loud asshole about it and make other people lives miserable ?
Insomnia is being so tired, but your body and mind don't allow you to keep your eyes closed or your brain to shut off. Insomnia is having no phone or anything around you, but darkness, &amp; still not being able to sleep. I hate this! Sleeping pills or melatonin don't work either.
Yet again no signal with @EE! Struggling to see why I pay a monthly phone contract for a phone I can’t even bloody use to call out on! Once this contract ends, I’m off 👋🏽 https://t.co/UFVrbBhHt7

@ThreeUKSupport I can’t recall the exact stretch, but it was between Doncaster and London. For about for 40 minutes of that journey, I had a no internet connection at all.
@LightboxNZ do you guys think you could fix downloads? Like, when an episode is finished, maybe automatically play the next one instead of saying there’s no internet. That would save trying to reach back to play the next episode of Paw Patrol and swerving all over the road 😂
Don’t you hate it when you’ve got no internet connection? 🤔
@saimakhan31 It's like a contract phone where you pay monthly but unlike direct debit, you have to pay the bill either online or physically in the counters. With no internet and curfew, how would people pay for the service they never received. #Kashmir

@NavinMhatre_ @Flipkart @shripadk14 Ofcourse as a company they are not liable to buyback faulty phones but some of the reasons being cited for rejecting buyback are ridiculous &amp; make this whole thing look like a scam. No phone is going to be in factory condition after 8-9 months of usage.
@VodafoneUK Replied, thank you. We have now moved so no internet access now (as Vodafone hasn’t updated) so slow replies.

After 70 days, post-paid mobile connectivity has been restored in Kashmir. Some relief from the anguish. There is NO Internet, no pre-paid mobiles. People are still cut off and the media is still crippled. What will the SC do on Oct 16, when it hears @AnuradhaBhasin_'s petition?
@O2 who do I speak to regarding having NO phone for the last week? No reception, can’t use it! #GettingNoWhere
@MartinSLewis are you aware of the @VodafoneUK roaming charges farce.... they’ve gone into meltdown. Say I owe £1,200 for one day in Dublin! On hold for 1 hour 5 mins so far with no phone service as they have blocked it... compensation required I think... https://t.co/h9RfiuhOd7

@taekicks @ByronsShade I used to divide my time between my home in the mountains and the city. The first day back in the mountains was strange. No internet. My cell phone rarely even had a phone connection. It always took me 48 hours to disconnect, mentally. Anxiety followed by peace.
And this halfwit bhakt @listenshahid thinks no phone network was perhaps the only biggest complaint since Aug 5. #Kashmir https://t.co/lz6RZgeDHP

@brianwong_path No phone support until 6:15 am. Apple online chat has disconnected twice. The back up froze. Now I can’t even reconnect to the disk. It’s super frustrating especially at 2 am.
@VodafoneUK My sister still has no phone. Even though we are away she is expecting a very important work call. Restore her service please. You have already totally ruined a proportion of her break due to her thinking she had run up a bill of £8000.

A fate #worse than death awaited us. Stuck in a frozen wasteland, no communication at our disposal, food supplies gone, those of us still alive had the unenviable task of waiting out our days subsisting on the remains of our colleagues. At least the meat would stay fresh. #vss365
My ultimate goal: Me and God= A1Bread more than stackedTravel the world with no phoneHave undisturbed peace✨
@soledadobrien I am thinking Michael Meyers, Deliverance, Unibomber, Atlanta Olympic Bomber, and lynchings- that is what I think of in extreme isolation - no I am not going anywhere by my self with no communication- there could also be a flood. I see that pic and I think Stranger Danger

Last week’s Mt Isa hearing showed why our Senate Inquiry into the Govt’s Nth Aus agenda is needed. North West Qlders say they’ve received “little or no communication” from the Govt or the NAIF. They’ve got good ideas and it’s time the Govt listened. https://t.co/8zf9YzZvJ6

Yes, i'd clean the cemetery overnight for $80 an hour.I'd sleep in the haunted mansion for $100,000.Of course i'll stay in a huge mansion for $10,000 for a month with no internet.I'll LIVE in that bathtub full of roaches for $1,000,000. 100% no prob.Most who struggle would.
Good morning folks. On holiday from work so off to my mum's this morning for a few days. No internet and I don't have much data on my phone so will be a sparce  appearance from me here. Probably early morning and late evening. Have a blessed day and week xx

@bludgeonmyself_ @callhertiti @wokeorwhatev @beckybeck69 If all you came to do is call me a racist, don’t @ me I don’t got the time for that.

@soledadobrien I’m alone 99.2% of the time anyway, without paying bucks. No internet would suck.
@ASTROGaming @EBGamesAus  I paid for the Astro A40 TR + Mixamp TR (Gen 4) in full on September 7th $450. I was told it would be here in two weeks max. They said they would update me if anything happens, its been over a month no phone call or text. This is absolutely ridiculous.
@virginmedia @Mr_Tango_hotel The point of the matter is it’s day 10 of no internet and im told I may have to wait another 7 days!
@virginmedia now into 3rd day of no internet in RG31 postcode. No text updates, despite twice requesting this so I can try to plan my working day today and where kids do homework tonight. Any chance of knowing what’s going on and what kind of bill credit we’ll be getting?!

Second @TPG_Telecom outage in a month lasting more than half the day. No notice on service page, no communication, nothing. The only thing they have going for them is that @NBN_Australia is such a botch job.

Nanny State.  Pink laws.  No smoking in restaurants and planes.  Owing to Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, minimum age for alcohol changed to 21.  Laws requiring use of helmets and seat belts.  Also, no communication threat to wife, or girlfriend.  Pink ink essence of law book.
@supermo0 It's actually wild.  Even ignoring how they directly tied 8 seasons of "story" into it and how absurd that is, shutting off one of the probably top 3 games in the world for 9+ hours with literally NO communication, updates or anything is super fascinating and insane.

@Kathologist I recommend using the online resources (and apps) to study for the ham radio tests, and then find a local amateur radio club that runs testing events. Should be a list on https://t.co/BtSKO88ERD - can be useful w/the "no power" and "no phone" situation.

It's getting longer, I don't get how in this age there is no internet connection for 4 working days out of 10, and this happening from past few years. Most are pensioners waiting patiently to get a number so that a doctor can see them. At least provide them better service
@DockRogersNC No electricity, no phone no cable. You owned your land so I kinda get it.
Literally can’t find no internet available around me after I been using the same service 3 months. Probably was paying too much any damn way smh

I feel I'm doing much better away from social media. It's been a week or so phoneless and kinda like it. I log on and see news stories and I feel hopeless and trapped. I log off and try to be present. It's difficult. Staying present. I like avoiding situations and people

@amazon @AmazonHelp So, the offered "solution" I was given was that the Amazon UK rep would get Amazon India to call me."Um, when...I am on holiday, in New York!""Soon."An hour passes, no phone call. I waited in my apartment, rather than go out, in case I missed it.Daylight is burning. 😡
I swear if my phone keeps glitching out I’m throwing it away and going phoneless. Jesus. I’ve had enough.
@CHIZMAGA @kohlweiler THERE WERE NO PHONE CALLS DUHHHHH.
@Uber_Support You need failsafe for when rider who’s left a phone in a car can have a friend reach out to you. Standing on the side of the road with no phone or laptop dies nothing. You insist on continuing to tell him to clink a link he had access to. Thank God to a very kind driver today.

There is literally no communication between the community and #Epicgames. #TheEnd
Seeing all those, "you get to live in this house but no internet,no phone" like no. I'm sorry I'm addicted, taking the internet from me is like taking my motivation, my will to live, my source of validation and love. Like no. Ain't having that.
@JentoInfinity @JakeOfOnline I honestly don’t mind the no internet, no phone, but the number of things you’d have to do without for there to be no electricity is just … no. No.No fridge? No lights? No exhaust fan in the bathroom? No washer or dryer? No listening to music?Absolutely not.
No internet and kind of depressed, not a fun night.

@realDonaldTrump You need to be in a straight jacket. If someone had taken on that responsibility sooner, Kurds and their wives and children would not be at the mercy of the Turks, who are murdering them with your seal of approval. No phone conversation you have is good.
no phone for now hmu on here!
@c7_manoj fair enough. you really must've been hurt emotionally to use this many laughing emojis and insults but, that was to be expected. you say you're fully done with this game but you still retweet and cOnGrAtuLAtE, which means you clearly can't get over your fifa mobile addiction.

@MONALPATEL2009 @MirMAKOfficial @scsequences @narendramodi @KTHopkins @karanjohar Whats happening in kashmir is my research!! Why the blackout? Why the curfew? Why no communication? Why no internet?

Had them all daaaaay so being phoneless for a couple hours today was well worth it.
having no internet connection for a day is like 10years outdated.  tough.

@TPG_Telecom Why do you claim to include a phone line when there is no phone line now you get NBN?  Even the NBN doco says you loose your existing phone line. Isn’t that false advertising?

@TheDonsQuill For the ones with no internet presence, they might find other ways to lash out and harm the person’s reputation or bring embarrassment to the person. Ultimately, it’s about going public with it. Online media is just the easiest way to go about it.
@baconstain It was 38 degrees with a wind chill of 26 the last time I checked on Saturday.And god forbid, people use technology! They should play in leather helmets and long-sleeve sweaters no matter what the weather. No communication devices, no MRIs, no tech at all.

@VodafoneUK I haven't been worried about the £4,543.50 bill you've assigned to me on the app after 24hrs in Amsterdam when it should've been part of my UK pay monthly allowance. What is most upsetting is 18hrs with no phone voice or data connection. Without WiFi I'm contactless.😤

@Tracy_Siv @ArmandoNDK I understand. I just spent the weekend at a camp with no internet access. It was wonderful.
I cant belive this tweet sent i have almost no internet signal hi I'll be back home on Monday
@wallzerbear @VodafoneUK Agree. Their handling of this has been really poor. I ended up travelling home alone after 10.30pm with no phone as I’m cut off. I don’t believe there’s not a quick fix to getting us all back on.
@VodafoneUK i have sent you multiple direct mails now. When are you actually going to sort this issue out? No phone and been told I’ve been charged thousands in a roam free area ????? Lol
I think people are pissed because there is no communication from epic and most people just spent hours staring at a screen. @SypherPK
@VodafoneUK check your Messages. Currently have NO phone signal.

@TrevDon Is it safe? With no phone, what if there are intruders or an emergency? A storm? Solitude I can handle. Complete isolation &amp; unsafe conditions? I think not. $10,000 is not enough of an incentive!
@Commons62160373 @RatnerFake @GinaDrosos Mine never said that. There has been no communication about it being an error and the shifts had to be entered into the system by end of day Thursday.
@VodafoneUK Any news on sorting out yet? No phone for over 5 hours?
@stigsgamingtv @tajourius With no communication whatsoever! 🤣
Who at @FortniteGame decided that making their players wait for hours on end with no communication was a good idea? They turned the hypest gaming event into a lame snooze fest. Seriously bad move guys. Very disappointed
Bit grumpy at My Republic, spent an hour troubleshooting an issue that they really should have been able to solve in 10 seconds, now I have no Internet until wed pm.
@VodafoneUK @warmwon I’m still trying to get even an acknowledgment from Vodafone. Stuck abroad with no signal or data, and a text to say they’re suspending my account?!
so board... nothing to do... no one to talk to... no phone...
@realDonaldTrump You're saying there was no phone call? Hmmm.
@AisforInterval In the long, long ago of the 80s there was no internet, so you'd have to go to movies like this to get a hint of a boobie and also to make out in the back row.
@kvliie i didnt get no phone call
my nigga I got off work at 5pm yesterday I then lost my phone at I would say roughly 6:30pm I then started pre drinking until about roughly 10:35pm from this point I remember shorty whipping her pussy out in the line entering midway exiting midway and waking up with no phone.
@JTonYouTube I’ve dealt with no internet for a week because everyone at suddenlink besides a woman saying “we can’t fix that”

No one wants to be on this team or working the scheme on either side of the ball right now.We've had bad years. This is the most deflated I've ever seen a pro team...
So after 4, long days. With no phone or watch/clock. I’ve made it home from the most amazing weekend i’ve ever experienced completing the 2019 Rice parish men’s ACTS retreat. This was the best decision i’ve ever made for myself in life. God is good, all the time!😇 https://t.co/d2O4dbXuId

@ivyjofreeman I'm kind of in the same boat. No cable. No Internet. Can't afford to pay for more than the 5 free articles a month in the newspapers. I see news on YouTube, Twitter, &amp; push notifications to my phone. Oh, yeah... my rabbit ears got NBC last night!
@SCD_Live_Tour @dev_101 @dbuzz6589 There should be no phone votes, just voting online
@kirstenjh Such ignorance or are they just lies? It’s still valid in Spain and Ireland with more to come. No phone company has said it will end data roaming, indeed it’s available in more non-EU than EU countries -but hey less gloom if you’d been truthful.
I finally got WiFi installed at my place. I haven’t had a phone or internet for like 3 months lol. Not having it was admittedly pretty nice though. I’ve felt a lot more upfront and confident lately and I think it’s because of no internet.
Is there no internet? An online subscription might be more economical. Patrons really want that smell of ink and rustle of paper. 😀It used to come via Greyhound to rural Alberta. https://t.co/xpe5uIr8vr

@Daya43121454 @Jeff__Benjamin Sorry I had no internet, what?
having no phone and not being able to use social media as much is soo therapeutic
The amount of times I have to restart my game, get unknown error messages, and kicked off mid game for “no internet connection” is way too high and is absolutely insane.
@MarlenaGraves We had a basket at the back door for collecting them at parties at our house.  We got some looks, but told the kids they could come make needful texts or calls anytime they needed to.  Was like we’d let the air out of a balloon.   But everyone had fun. Had no phone drama.
@DDAENGKYUN WHO IS IT I HAVE NO INTERNET
@asg_6420 Nothings happened at all, for about 3 hours they shut the game down and have had no communication with the community at all for the people willing to keep up with the game. They are putting out random numbers and the game is locked on a black hole screen

@RogersHelps currently in London Ontario with no phone, internet, etc for the entire day. Phone lines wait times are insanely busy. Seems to be a common trend across south western Ontario. Are we suffering an outrage?
@VodafoneUK I can’t even use the vodafone app because I can’t connect to the network I am stranded in Prague with no phone what am I supposed to do how long will all our accounts be blocked
Got no internet at the minute so spent the whole weekend on the lap top building tunes. Loved every second! Man does time fly though 🔊🔊🔊🔊
Cant stop thinking about the baby I saw at a techno event at 2am. No phone. Just vibing.

10.12.19 It's been a long time~ 🌊 Sometimes you just need to chill and live life away from the city. It was fun! There was no signal so it was also a plus that I'm away from my phone. So happy and free!~ 🍃Ice Bear was at Sayaw Beach Resort in Barili, Cebu. 🤗 https://t.co/ZaZVWauG71

@Jamwanda2 @glenmpani @edmnangagwa I am in some rural erea were Zanu PF has been winning since 1980. One of the current VPs has been MP since 1985 until the coup. There is no development, nothing! No roads, no communication. We rely on SA for phone networks and clinics for pregnant women. You know the area Cde.
@MichaelGarage3 No signal at Park Farm. Normally that would occasion angst, fear, loathing and near terminal distress in  the boys, but they were so excited they didn't care. It was lovely. I am so drained I am at no.4 of a planned 36 G&amp;Ts, but they were so excited about everything. Fab to see!
@alexjkane Or when there’s no internet because someone called you
@JST9 Oh, and there'll be no internet, we're going back to pre industrial revolution days....

@ShaiDeLuca I travel alone extensively. Women have to use their brains when deciding where to travel alone. Stop traveling to unsafe places just to post selfies! I went to Cuba this year + did organized tours—No way was I walking around by alone in a place with no phone or internet
Battling with @DIRECTV and @ATT going on 3 years over receivers that I returned and they insist I did not. Thought this was resolved till I got mail from a 3rd different credit collection agency after months of no communication. Now what? I just pay for equipment I don’t have?

being phoneless is terrible

My wireless carrier has seen fit to give me one final slap in the face, with no internet, before, unbeknownst to them, I cancel my "service", a loose term for the crap-sandwich they have shelled out lo, these last 18 months. So, long @ATT , it's been an absolute nightmare. 🙄

Glad to know post-Brexit plans have already been implemented by my phone company, who cut off all calls, texts, + data after a few days in Amsterdam using my plan claiming (incorrectly) 'unusually high usage', leaving me phoneless in Luton with skant idea of how to get home.

@sardesairajdeep There is mobile service but no internet service in some parts of the valley. However many schools don't permit mobile phones across the country. And BTW if the parents are scared about the security of their children, then it is not a situation created by the Security forces.

West Virginia is one of the most beautiful states I have ever been. The bad reputation, lack of cell service and no internet in the Seneca area has kept this place a secret. I’ve got some stories to tell when I return to town and can get online. Tuesday. 🤠

Selling Orbit 2.0 with no communication regarding a comeback, a reality show, OT12 variety appearances, V-Lives, social media, literally anything? It’s not a good look and I’m severely disappointed.
They built up momentum and lost it all just as quickly. They’re a rookie group and a six month hiatus is unheard of. Their large global fanbase sets them apart but a half of year with no communication jeopardizes all of that. BBC is fucking up.
@Bell_MTSHelps Is power down in charleswood area, I've had no internet or tv since yesterday at 2pm
I was out with family for 3 hours and had no internet and I literally didn’t think about it once but I come back home and I’m in bed sad about it all again

You meet someone. You two get close. It's great for a while. Then someone stops trying, talk less, awkward conversations. The drifting. No communication whatsoever. Memories start to fade. Then that person you know becomes that person you KNEW. That's how it usually goes, right?

@Thigh_Ground @postedbygaslite @Behemous I missed both marketing campaigns.  No internet in the lead up to TFA and no interest in the lead up to TLJ. (I think you've both heard how much I hated TFA until after seeing TLJ)

@ZkotosKoritsi I had no internet for 3 weeks!Nice rest &amp; time to catch up on reading.I read The Prince by Machiavelli, some scary Eugenics tripe from the founders of Fabians, lots of very interesting pdfs about the real science of climate &amp; other stuff I had downloaded but never fully read.
@docrocktex26 @priorylives @missfreckles1 It was my first election, and our ability to weed out information was dependent on our nightly news, and newspapers.  There was no effective way to research.  There was no internet, computers, all we had was, at the time, a law? that demanded tv news had to be truthful.
Yet another day of no one ans the phone at the call centre and no internet for me.
@VodafoneUK switching to Vodafone seems like a bad choice. I connected on 4th October on super fast 2 broadband. Not receiving the guaranteed 55mbps. Now have no internet until the 16th of October due to technical issue. Really not a good start at all

@bt_uk I already know there are issues in my area. It’s just unclear when it will be repaired. Website states 5 days, 0800 states within 2 hours and chat said tomorrow. So I don’t know what to believe - also minihub won’t work in my area - no phone signal in the village.

@jens_skittles Yeah if I remember correctly their customer support is like all online in a forum and no phone calls. I might be thinking of revolut thoughI used to work for a company like them and would think wtf...I don't want to take calls or emails
@AmericanAir We're getting delay updates, but no communication on why or if the flight is actually happening. A 3 hour delay now for mechanical issues does not inspire confidence.

@PLDT_Cares I’m quite annoyed with your service 1 week no internet in Manila is no Joke. I always have to spend extra just to catch up with my studies and work. Is us paying the wifi bill still not enough? 🤦🏽‍♂️
@tyillc Better but impossible as some of them were committed to communicate by their policy institution. No communication policy could destroy the policy you have to promote. Btw, some policies work only with a strong communication. Hence, not enough communication could be the flaw 😉
@cece_feels There was no communication! Their communication strategy was the website with the levels. Nothing at community radio stations, community papers. So I don't know what that tender Tony got went to.
The best part about Danjugan is the fact that it is NOT a resort. It is a marine reserve and sanctuary with no signal, no freshwater source, and very limited electricity from solar panels. For me, it gave me time… https://t.co/zgqpBZfJlr

@QuickMobileFix appalling service from this company, no phone within the 3 different delivery date promises and now no refund within the stipulated time frame. Seriously out of pocket. Would not recommend.

@brandicarlile If not for hundreds of yt videos from your fans i would've never get to know you 10 y ago and become a loyal fan all this years, so not a fan of no phone shows. For true fans we'll be missing the excitement, comments and community that sharing brings.

@VodafoneIN has the worst data services. My 3G is ultra slow in any part of Hyderabad. I switched to 4G sim and it worked fine the first week, but after that it doesn’t work. Literally not working. Nothing loads, no internet. Forces me to revert back to 3G, which is also useless.

@comcastcares , I suddenly have no Internet, my phone was logged out of the "my xfinity" app, my credentials do not work to log back in, and I get "this information does not match our records" when I try to log back in. No email saying account info changed. WTH?
That interweb thing is overrated. Nice trip down memory train from Berlin to Dresden, no Wifi, no 3G, often no phone service at all. Just like in the 1980s. The message is clear: Take a bus! https://t.co/6AQTEGS0W2

@ATTHelp Approaching 48 hours with no internet. Is there an ETA as of yet to resolve this issue?
Powercuts in Pune are getting ridiculous. This is supposed to be a city! Sometimes I prefer staying back at work and getting on web conferences because power randomly goes off at home and then no internet. Even the 4G signal drops when power goes off, so that's iffy too. 🤷‍♂️

@Flipkart how is that possible on this planet,Since I ordered an item from flipkart on 5th oct and still not delivered yet which originally had to be delivered on 11th oct,either way no communication has been received from them as well.I never expected this kind of service.
@runerart I’m naturally extremely introverted, Being social was learned because I had no communication skills whatsoever and they’re necessary to have a job; w/o them I wouldn’t give a fuck what I said to anybody or how they felt about it.
@DhyInn Idk I unplugged and reset everything, but still didn’t work, so I left it for like an hour or so and then started working again. I think it might be a problem with the network provider and not the router bc I could connect to the router, but there was just no internet.
@Ph03n1x24 Not jiving with me either, Newsome ordered guns to be taking away,  no communication with ham radios, power shut off, DEW setting fires. For cover. We all know Newsome isn't gonna help Trump.
24 hours no internet. What happened to @ACTFibernet? Have raised the complaint but noone seems to pay heed to it. Can we look at some solutions @ACTBangalore
@Coolie_Cassie I didn’t get no phone call no text no nothing from you

@BSNL_PB I got fed-up with such a poor service. See the status of broadband # 1612819810 I have, as per pics attached. After some use it shows the red light i.e. no internet or most of time it shows ni signals as per second picture. Ever since I bought this problem persists. https://t.co/t3jIPgRUNH

@airtelindia The internet connectivity of airtel in my region #logegaon pune411047 brings the sound memory of 2g days.. i even raised internet speed or better say no internet issue to the customer care to which they are yet to update after the said 24hrs. People in my area are giving up!

@ACTFibernet No internet since yesterday morning, what's the update on SR10231200126262? Too frequent disconnection along with slow resolution makes it a horrible choice for reliability, will switch provider unless issue resolved quickly, act must refund when it was not working

To pay $5,000+ dollars for a senior to live in a place, specifically Churchill House in North Vancouver and the place is not clean and no communication exists. Parent cannot do anything on their own  but not one person gets back to me. It is ridiculous.

@youbroadband 17 hours and counting and still no internet. Thank God for Airtel and Reliance Jio that i can still surf the net on my mobile. Powai team is absolutely incapable of handling requests. Refuse to share escalation matrix despite repeated requests.
Worst customer service by @ACTFibernet - they sack most of the people to cost cut &amp; now noone is there to pick up the call. Automation will not work if you r handling unstable system. Last 30hrs no internet in home and no one responded otherthan couple of text messages.

@OceanGirl124 Understood. But if it's not fear of going to jail, fear of losing jobs, fear of being beaten or killed, then why aren't 150 million people in the streets?Nixon was almost half a century ago. I don't think we can use that as a reference point. We only had TV then, and no internet
i just broke my only 2 chargers i had,,, and now i'm phoneless :(

@Musicfreak78 @TeresaRJ3 @MarkRPellegrino Everyone told me I wouldn't survive living on what was prob 10 percent of my old income. Well, I did, and I was happier for it.

@advmdrivers Can you take a step back and realize that NO internet fight is worth a job? I get that you’re a kid, but that’s someone’s whole livelihood and you’re willing to get it taken away because someone likes a ship that you don’t. Kira is the furthest thing from an abuser and u know it.

@WOWCare no internet here in Columbus. Is there an outage or just me?

Imo, there's a more sinister reason ham operators r being banned. If a political faction attempted a physical coup of our President, they would probably shut down the internet, cell phones &amp; television 1st. No communication would hamper civil unrest. I've become a conspiracist 😬
There's a possibility that in the next few hours #Ecuadorians will be left with no Internet access and unable to make callsI guess it's a strategy to calm people downBut it's just another way to destroy ppl's liberty

@Ask_Spectrum A repair guy was scheduled, Brandon came out. He got me halfway. After replacing the router, for the second time, we have my laptop working. I still have no internet on my home office PC. The main one I NEED. Everyone is insisting something has changed on the PC itself...
NO PHONE TIL MONDAY HMU ON HERE FOR NOW!!!!
No internet and dial tone since Friday and same happened last week. We've been calling Globe's customer service every week due to either no connection or very slow internet speed even though basic trouble shooting has been done since we started this plan. It is so frustrating
@realDonaldTrump @ChuckGrassley @joniernst @debfisher @BenSasse Last time you said you spoke with china, China confirmed there was no phone call!  So whenever we hear China confirm it we will possibly believe what if any agreement was made. A shame we can't believe you. A shame!

@s8n I heard Hell only has Dial-up, and that there are no phone lines in Hell.
Unfortunately floored by @JWMarriott’s lack of communication/customer service rn. We just arrived to our hotel, which they overbooked for the night. This is the first we’ve heard of this. No email. No phone call. Scrambling to find something else.
@ellenbyronla I feel for you but you haven't tangled with PS4 or Xbox yet. Every time I hit the chat link, I'm routed to the page I came from with "helpful" answers to my questions. No phone numbers to call. No emails.
@ATTHelp I left to go to get something to eat. I get back and all everything is out! No internet and no U-verse. My home phone is not working either???
@JuliettGulf @vashmcl TSTT came and installed their WiFi system by us (we did not ask for it). So there's no landline anymore, guess what? When there isn't any electricity from T&amp;TEC there is no phone service.
hahaha no phone day today, 🤣🤣 tf
Late last night my 13yr old cousin put up a pic of a girl in his whats app story with the caption MINE (he nowwwww start school eh).... SO i screen shot and put it in the family group and now he in trouble with no phone 😂🤣😂
@semii_semi Nvk would be banned too then, if stuff from years ago resulted in a ban currently. The only reason we’re complaining so much is because we don’t even know why he was banned, no communication with actual evidence. Just “toxic behaviour” that could have been present or years ago.
@The_FortniteGuy so I just got a brand new pc I was all excited to set it up when I finally set it up I go to turn on the monitor it turns on reads no signal and shuts off hasn't been able to turn on since

@hotroast221 i hear peeing on things around the place is a good way to let other residents know youre upset with something thats going on, and its a no communication method, they just have to figure out what to do to appease you or you pee on more things in greater quantities. source: cats
I realized that one of my biggest pet peeves is people who lack follow through. I’m like damn. I’m not unreasonable. Life happens. Shit changes. Can I get a text? This no communication Whit is getting on my nerves.

@Katzerax no jack, no phone
@cwoo4u Hey no phone???
If you live in an area that has @ShawInfo, don’t waste your money. 35 minute wait for customer service while I have no internet, cable or phone, for the third time in a week. Glad the hundreds of dollars we pay monthly is “good value”. Think it’s time to switch to @TELUS.
@sh_irredeemable @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerPelosi It's amazing how silent the media is about central California the 800,000 plus that are without power which means - no water, no communication, no food, no stores open, no gas ...totally cut off. The media is totally silent. If the gov was Republican all hell would break loose

@Nicki_Doyle My ndp candidate is a surfer so there are a few up around the beach but that’s it. No literature. No phone calls. No gotv. This is Peter stoffer’s riding. The infrastructure is here. It’s very odd except it isn’t.
No internet till tomorrow 3-5pm. Had to schedule a tech guy 😭😭.I hate Comcast shit should be simple!!!
@cabot_w @BernadetteNoBot @Mel_Ankoly That’s why the candidates campaign. Think about campaigning for president in 1936. No tv, no internet, not a lot of face time with candidates because they had to travel by train or car. And vehicle travel was Ltd by lack of highways. People listened to the radio &amp; read the paper
Love my life. No internet cap

Govt. has been claiming that things are normal now, but I don't know anything about it. No media coverage, no internet, how would I know if things are really normal, let them speak up at least, let them connect with us. https://t.co/TW4xPNQvhk

@Sportsnet Shapiro needs to go. Absolutely no communication with players and management. Jays players, the fans and all of Canada deserve better. I would like to see a competitive team put together again, but I don't see it anytime soon if Shapiro and Atkins are in charge.

@billgood_news I totally understand no texting and driving but it's become so much more now. How about make it simple, no phone in your hands. WTH is wrong with putting your phone in the cup holder while you're charging it. Stops it sliding around &amp; becoming a distraction.
So I had to go outside for a minute and accidentally  locked myself out😟 no phone it was inside so had to wait about an hour for somebody to help me get back in my toes were turning blue and all I had on was my sweater. I'm soooo cold😨 https://t.co/0N4gC4qhCM
No internet until Tuesday. Will we survive?

It was nice being off the grid for a few  hours. There was zero signal out there. So no internet or phone. Between the crisp, clean, Autumn air, the clear skies, the amazing foliage colors, it was all just so peaceful. Actually spent a lil time reading a book, sitting out there.

Ah man living as a teenager during the 1980s is something I REALLY wished to have experienced 💔 😢 when music and movies were at their height, dictatorships were crumbling across the world, no internet existed to distract us from social life and there was only TWO genders! https://t.co/orSFZFC4pA
So lads. No internet at my apartment until Wednesday. So, that will be the next stream and it will be a good one! So happy I got my own place. Stream quality will significantly improve cause of it.
No cable means no internet either. Which means I'm cut off from any form of communication because I live in the damn woods. That's why this is so important. I hate having to ask for help but I am, you can thank my insurance for not covering my anti-seizure medication. https://t.co/PSiEb9oklp

Have you taken your medication yet? I know you can get pretty emotional when you don't which is what I expect in your next post.
@comcastcares I just moved and was told they can’t get a tech out to me until next Thursday and I won’t be able to be around for the appointments until the following week! So over 2 weeks with no internet! Can you guys help at all? Thank you!!
@bitmaster177 @juninhosereno1 @RayRedacted @ElectrumWallet @CasaHODL Wait. What exactly do you mean? I guess they have some server that listens on local host for some UI of Casa node. TOR communicating has nothing to do with this, no? Communication to the Internet is https, anyway.

No internet means I can't upload my art aaaaaah

@boywithfancyluv no seriously, my data has run out and no internet at home so :/
@mach229 3 TV networks - no internet. It was a different time but our Constitution was challenged and withstood Nixon. It will stand up to this Moron. Public opinion is the key.
As much as I miss the 90's I sometimes wish I could've grown up in the 80's. Back when there was no Internet or Smart Phones and people were more chill. So many great movies, TV shows and the MUSIC my god. Seriously who doesn't love 80's music?

@queensaniia You tested me with the loyalty stuff and I tested you. I guess I passed your test and you failed mine in order to be done. I’ve been busy all day with no signal really until like now too so if you done you a quitter.
I grew up in Santa Cruz, very close to the epicentre. But my family &amp; I had moved back to NZ 4 weeks earlier. W/ no internet / cell phones &amp; most local phone lines down, our ability to get updates was extremely limited - all news in NZ centered on SF &amp; LA. https://t.co/b2B2dkhV4E

@Mr_Dave_Haslam 4 shows in London at the Ritzy Cinema, Brixton, 29 Sept - 2 Oct.  (I went to all 4- a seminal event, in my mind).  An extra one at Heaven, London, on 7 Oct, featuring Burroughs, Last Few Days and Marc Almond - very good too!  The one in Manchester.  No internet, yet alone Google!

the no phone life is actually quite fun yo, i just come on my laptop if i need to use the internet and post. i mean, posting pictures is hard, but doing things without a phone is great. you have to plan stuff ahead, my music is all on tape, and everything feels so special!
Why no phone cases yet @LindseyStirling @gwenstefani @amanda_shaw
@TrevDon Several reasons why no:-structural integrity-no Internet = no fun; no electricity = no cooking-I need to RUN-top priority: solitary is bad for mental health and I need to be able to bring my partner/roommate 💜

If I’m ever rich, I’m going to open a reading-only coffee shop. Only instrumental jazz will play, and you may talk, but only just above a whisper. Anything raucous will not be tolerated. Extra perks for not talking. Absolutely no phone calls. #amreading #WritingCommunity
@ATT why is there absolutely no signal in the middle of Williamsburg, Brooklyn? Get your shit together
So there's no communication ban now in Kashmir and there is peace unlike before Aug 5th. Only difference is that Muftis and Abdullahs were free before and now they're not. So I guess the solution to permanent peace is clear. #KashmirNormalcy
Now I understand why the president of USA lol Mr crazy Yeezy Had no phone for a while... *sign*
@Ask_Spectrum do we have any idea when internet will be resorted in Arlington 76001. No internet since Power got restored Yesterday?

I currently have no internet, so no streaming services, so I find myself watching Jurassic Park for the hundredth time on itv2.
KIAS-15 by @BMTC_BENGALURU is a super boon for Whitefield residents. Unbelievably it brought me to Hope farm in 59 minutes flat. During evening hours. No signal, no pick-up or drops, non-stop home to airport at 1/4 cost. Alas only 4 passengers on board. This route needs more love
@LHambone It’s not upsetting. I catch myself from Tim to time. What gets me is people do it knowing it’s the wrong move and no communication. It’s like people feel like they can do it themselves and don’t consider the fact that we are a “team” it gets annoying after awhile
Was in the middle of nowhere in South Carolina with no internet no WiFi. A humbling experience
@SkyHelpTeam Been paying insurance but it’s been invalid apparently because the package is something you don’t offer. Been on the phone for over and hour and upgraded to sky Q... to now have no signal again and no tv channels?
@ATTHelp I’m glad you’re happy. I have no internet until Monday.
@Quotemehappy Not a happy customer at all at the moment. Got an email from you asking for updates on payment details before renewal. Just back from abroad to find website down till Monday. No phone number to get in touch to sort it out.Renewal due tomorrow.will I still be insured
@Ips_cali @agcolehamilton You need to phone 999 anyway as obviously you need expert care as quickly as possible. Easy enought to get a neighbour to call but number of homes with no phone is very small. But still, best way is for someone to collect AED as another rings emergency services
@CHIMPSINSOCKS See that Rex? See that guy switch lanes, straight across us? No signal! I'll get alongside. You know what to do. Do it well...

Why to choose BSNL/MTNL, for no coverage, no internet, no 4G, less 3G network with slow speed, high call charges? Even when there is no 3G/4G we feared to have BSNL SIM for its predatory price/call rate. Who's responsible for this BSNL or customers? Sir waiting for your answer. https://t.co/fHcSgs1DAY

@TrevDon Hmm, my grandparents had that exact same setup. No internet, electricity, etc. Except it was in the jungle provinces in the Philippines. Their food were their chickens &amp; the nearest mango tree. Amazing what people in the 21st century industrialized world are willing to pay. 🌏

Hey @SkyUK ... how come your not updating your LOYAL customers that their package is no longer valid... and just waiting for them to have no signal sent to their box?

@KnifeWifeMukuro "Contact support. I did this multiple times on different accounts and it worked every single time. Just tell them your account was blocked without you doing anything wrong and you have no phone to unlock it."From reddit.
I'm using the data I don't have to say that I'm not ignoring y'all friends, it's just that I LITERALLY have no internet for now. Like, the little box with data that we got until our internet is back isn't working anymore, SUDDENLY so I can't reply or even load SNS

@British_Airways poor service from B.A.Original flight to Vegas from UK  delayed from 1740 to 1800hrs, then 1830hrs, then 18.45hrs. Apparently due to late incoming flight. Now the first announcement (no communication during this period) the flight is delayed again until 1945hrs
Also, the delay in my one to green Tweet actually posting is a demonstration of me having no signal on the tri-oval photo tower.#NASCAR | #SugarlandsShine250

@arsenalcircular The suggestion would be to round them all up and dump them on a deserted island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with no communication devices what so ever and only themselves and sharks to keep them company.
@dcexaminer Buh Bye, Shep. I liked you until you became a pod person and developed TDS.  you’ve become a shell of a person-no soul. Cure: take 2 years and turn off all media, no phone, tweets, nothing. Go away from cities, people. Read. Fiction only. Classics before 1800. Yr 2: 1800 to now.

New goal: no phone time during the weekends. It's honestly my most triggering thing for symptoms, but I, like many, love just fucking around on social media apps to waste time. So. We'll see if this helps my brain... I'm hoping yis.

@WokeHawaiian @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump @ShannonBream @FoxNews You obviously didn't study the Constitution or law, so try reading a book on the matter of impeachment. Additionally, very few had access to the original, and no phone call has leaked in 3 years, so that's BS!

@MSignorile I still don’t get it. Granted: evangelicals “Christians” seem to have no communication with outside sources, or even partners from other faith groups. The bubble wall is a mile thick reinforced bunker grade concrete. This is going to take decades to Un-fuck.
Another example of the way the left typically behaves: in your face yelling, profanity, aggression - no communication, just intimidation. Compliments of DC Dems! #DCDemsRage https://t.co/6YkIIWTnyT

@0fun_ashlie No internet?!?!? How will you survive??? 🤪🤪🤪

@qrsupport @qatarairways How not to treat business travellers. Fair enough cancelling flights. But No communication. No money for dinner. Not what you expect. I expect a call. I’m with my family on a once in a life time trip. Think of it from our perspective - the customers perspective!
@XboxSupport why is it that I cant play games offline? It tells me set this xbox as your home xbox, which it is. Then I go to settings and make sure, and I need to be online to do so, so I have no internet so I cant even change it so I can play offline.  Great job Microsoft

@horseslaughter0 I think yes &amp; no. Communication certainly makes it seem like there are more cancer cases. However, the population also has exploded since then, doctors can accurately diagnose cancers now without calling it consumption &amp; our life expectancy is much much higher too...so, maybe?

@metropolitonguy Unwanted messages are just that, unwanted. Learn to differentiate between that and there will no communication problem.
@CardChronicle @RealDYates @_DavidJKim The problem is the ref made no signal besides incomplete(so no indication why). Then when he went to talk the ref standing in the back of the end zone one of the other ones came and ushered him off the field before they could even consult about it.
@MrFatimehin The dudes argument is annoying me walahi.If there was no internet we would still absolutely nothing and not know we knew nothing. Has this guy gone for NYSC and seen graduates?

(2/2) with no phone he can’t 😔 Is there any way you could ask the conductor to maybe try and find him and someone who’d lend him a phone? It’s a free number to get it sorted, he just needs to phone himself. He’ll be very anxious on a train for 3 hours with no means of contact ☹️
Where there is no communication, there can be no transformation.
@TalkTalk Hello. Broadband down for days. Wifi and wired connections to router are fine but no internet. Three chat sessions didn’t solve it

@ntelng @ntelcare when you guys are planning a network downtime, please let's know ahead. I can't be paying you guys N17,500 a month to be having no internet access. Your network has been red on my modem since!

@Office_AQPk @setholdmixon @nytimes @AQpk Kashmir has world support as you say; how come the world has not been able to get the curfew lift from Kashmir? For God's sake this aint support, this is lip-service and we still find 9 million Kashmiris under curfew, no food, no communication, no health, no life, only terror.

@AmazonHelp 12 hours passed, still no communication from #Amazon to rectify the inconvinence caused to me due to their's technical support team fault.Pathethic customer support, never expected this kind of attitude from a worldwide company.
Typhoon expectation: scared, no power, no water, no internetTyphoon reality: feeling my entire building and shutters shake whilst I listen to future house on my speakers having confirmed my safety via online check-in¯\_(ツ)_/¯ as long as I have power it's a party for me

@GabbbarSingh Yeah it's quite noticeableNo internet though.
@notthatsid @UnSubtleDesi Interesting perspective. I can relate. Growing up in a small town of UP I've forgotten how many times we heard incidents of Durga/Kali/Saraswati visarjan having been attacked followed by curfew in town. I suppose no internet or frantic 24X7 news channels kept the stories local.
Bunch of crooks, this is a sham. These shut offs did nothing to prevent fires/loss of life. What is did do was endanger the public. @GavinNewsom tell me again about how progressive CA is, we just got thrown back to the days of sitting in darkness, no communication &amp; transit roads https://t.co/mms5ZQoVYA

Finally, communication lockdown to be lifted from Monday in Kashmir. Pre paid services won’t be restored yet. No internet yet. Hopefully parents will now send kids to school. Release of those under preventive detention should be next, India’s democratic credentials are at stake.

This delay in response is not only affecting my communication but also hurting my trust on such authorities. The authority responsible for facilitating communication has no communication protocols and is actually contributing to disrupt communication. @PTCLOfficial
@PMIevents @PMInstitute Why was @RogerLMartin not at the conference? I think it's very strange that there was no communication whatsoever about his replacement?
No communication, no leadership, athleticism over sound fundamentals and IQ, a dependence on 3 &amp; 4 man pressures. This defense that was doomed to fail from the start.

@ACTFibernet Really dissapointed with the kind of service provided by you. No internet from last 10 days, even no one is responding in a city like Bangalore. Is it any kind of corruption by raising the internet quota but not providing the same.

I eventually figured out that, yeah, they were treated like pariahs by a lot of people we knew, but not by mom. So when I started reading about it, I knew what I was reading about. (1970s, so no internet for me.)
@Telstra C’mon! Cable outage for more than 24hrs in CARLINGFORD!! No internet, no cable, no Foxtel!
What I don't like is seeing the motion man move to the wide side and there is little to no movement or seemingly no communication to account for a 3rd receiver on the wide side. Tucker has his work cut out for him
@MarsyArtsy The fact they not even taking anyyyyyy responsibility for that just baffles me, it was a whole ass month with no communication whatsoever and now they’re saying you’re the rude one? big yikes. communication is so important
#FlipkartBigBillionDays This is a scam. V ordered a TV on 29th sept with a promise of delivery on 5thoct. No feedback,  no communication,  last night was told when I called up it is cancelled. Pathetic experience. Never will touch u again,  happy with Amazon.
I schedule appointments like work. No appointment no phone call. My friends actually abide by it 😂 https://t.co/34hOjOvOiR
@nuurhaafizah Dm no phone awak. https://t.co/8hTFyMVVga
stop fucking complaining that there is no signal. ITS FOR UR OWN SAFETY DUMBASS!
Shiting with no phone be the worst
@BrynGrayskull @zeromaint You're right about the straying and no communication. If one is being blocked out then there's a problem. I'm not talking forcible YOU HAVE TO sex. I mean each other should have a certain amount of empathy for the other. To want to see to the other' needs. Doesn't have to be
@SKYserves No internet connection here. Rebooted the modem 5x already.. kindly read my DM. thanks
@MSF Atrocities in the Indian-Occupied-Kashmir increase the miseries of people  in Kashmir. No medicine, no food, no communication. Torture and killings by Indian troops is a great concern. World is waiting for another genocide!!!!!!!@UNGeneva @genocide_watch @RedCross
@kyleNSB no phone in sight, just vibes 😎
@ACTFibernet you guys have been giving terrible internet in Sai Vaibhav layout, Khajaguda, Hyderabad. No internet most of the times
@familyman20181 @pilarmel13 no communication means total and complete CONTrol by the government
@goairlinesindia Pathetic service. I have been told that flight from Nagpur to Ahmedabad on 30.10.2019 has been cancelled. No communication. When it comes to inconvenience of customers, @goairlinesindia is topper.
I told her that I had stopped by a friend’s house on the way home from the funeral. “They ain’t got no phone where you came from?!?” I was thinking how there couldn’t have been a more inopportune time to tell her about my “revelation”. She was already fussing.
I'm not sure if this stupid OTP isn't sending because I have no signal anywhere near my house, or because the system isn't working again.
Outta commission for the next 5 days 🙌🏾 no phone NO NOTHING ✌🏾
@ElleWCarter @msager @lpackard We had a computer in 86. Mac SE II. Had to get it upgraded to 1mb ram to run Prince of Persia. But no internet.
I’ll be away for the weekend and potentially have no internet for 4 days. So until then. Bye 👋
No phone number just Twitter
Not tf waiting up for no phone call I’m tf tideee
@zoeynknuckles No mobile service, no internet, no cable phone service, no electricity, no street lights. No one knew what was going on. Very scary for lots of people.
having no phone is so weird.
@risag713 @SweetTeaVee no we ain't ugh.. girl tell me about it. And what's worst is we in the middle of fucking no wheree with no phone service. Like typical scary movie shit ☹️ luckily WiFi we have.
One suggestion, he should follow his daughter and son-in-law and observe Shabbat. 25 hours no phone or media, one day a week with no firehose of yammering. While at it the media should follow as well. https://t.co/AP9aFqYryW
@AskFrontier I'm guessing this happening everywhere? I live in Yucaipa CA and we've had no internet since 10am, its 8:42pm now. What's going on?

@Nichola49068529 @love4thegameAK @Carolin15161363 @CoryGroshek Agree. With this latest PG&amp;E outage in NoCA, there was no cable phone service, no mobile phone service and no internet. People would be in serious trouble if a new fire DID break out break out--can't call the fire dept!  Quake, grid out? People would be sitting ducks...
Living my best life fr. No internet shit.
@parsonshanged @moleculesofyou @peakcapitolism A structure from when there was no internet and conference calls were a brand new technology that relies on like 8 hours of deliberation every two years? What could be wrong with that
@Mim5453 I can’t with radio. Every now and again when we’re on the road, but not often. All noise, no signal.
@Wilson_Creek super unfortunate that we bought tickets Months ago and took a half day of work to drive to your winery for a concert with no communication and no concert - honesty wins and keeps customers this will put you on blast
I travel across the country 2-3 X a month, most usually on @AmericanAir. The service I’ve received this week has been the most atrocious in all my years in the air. Not one timely flight, no communication why, no respect or consideration of customers or their lives. Pathetic.
@optimistsurgeon All I can say is the parents are fools! @sardesairajdeep   Elsewhere parents would be sooo happy if there was no internet! I pity these kids, and pity people who watch your #fakenews .

@BSNL_KL @BSNLCorporate Its been 2 WEEKS and I'm stuck with no internet connection. what should I do in this point. I complained everywhere and I don't get any positive response. Is this how bsnl provide  service to  customer who is using bsnl from last 10 years????.
when ur phone is so dry you thought you had no internet &lt;&lt;&lt;
Back to back days of THE worst @Postmates service ever. I will officially never use them again after tonight . I sent an email to the Postmates support email since there are NO phone numbers to call. #fooddelivery #CustomerService
@bhar0 we had no internet connection back home at that time, unless if you worked on a big university. so the "fiber optic" stuff was totally the "ooo...shiny!" factor. :-D
The misery did not follow, no phone call no texts, no misery. That's what you,  sorry I used the wrong word, not escaped, but left behind.
You ever just wanna disappear for a few days and not tell anyone turn your phone off and just fall if the bride for a while with no communication to the rest of the world or is that just me?
Cidco convention centre, Vashi, Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra is the strangest place for conferences.No working Wi-Fi. Almost no phone reception inside the conference halls.I had a presentation that required mobile enabled q&amp;a session.Nothing worked.
Today ıt's my son's first school trip.I basically scratched him off the floor and dragged him to the bus. He waved at me like he would never see me again.When I was 6,my mom send me on summercamp with complete strangers in a complete different place, no phone, no cash,no letters https://t.co/a9frXVVDZz
With no internet or schools to keep them occupied, children have rediscovered the 'military-mujahid' game, enacting as entertainment the war which the Centre hopes its lockdown will avert. https://t.co/dPus6wKntp via @thewire_in

@Nashville_MMA @marc_benton @Model3Owners Agreed. To me the other thing they’re terrible at that Apple is great at is customer service. Once you take delivery, it’s like you’re a complete liability to them. No communication. No loaner, no above and beyond.
Take a bath tonight under the full moonNo phone just manifestations
@WatchVRV why do I keep paying for a service that runs worse than most pirate websites? Third day of services being down and no communication. I'm having a hard time finding reasons to continue my subscription
- writing lines- kneeling in the corner- do a chore alone - quiet time - no phone- cold shower- slap on the wrist- no social media- extra turns walking the dog- act of service for Daddy- time in the crate- sit on the floor instead of the couch- wash my mouth out1/2
Please tell me there is something better than no internet security and being denied access to my account because I can't remember the security answer I used three years ago. Then when I try to create a new account, I can't , because that email already has an account.
No phone n my son act like I can’t use his
@elonmusk So, no internet connectivity required for battery to work?
@Jesus_porvida I don't know of a Renaissance painting where pubic hair is evident. This is not about bathing. No energy for a week is not a warning. It will be the constant. No TV, no internet, no information.Time to really consider your choices, the truth, and a future of fruit or futility.

I sure do appreciate this 7-hour outage @comcastcares - no TV, no internet connection, can’t work from home, and worst of all, can’t watch college football. thanks for making the “time to cut the cord” problem a lot easier
For several days now, the state administration led by the governor and the Centre have tried to sell the narrative of normalcy in Kashmir to the rest of the country, when for 68 days there is no internet connection or mobile phone service in the Valley  https://t.co/3IOk3Jx1JQ

@proudhs2 I WAS OFFLINE HAVE NO INTERNET DATA OR WIFI! I'M PISSED😤
@Snapchat you guys should have an option for snapstreaks. Like if someones friend forgets to snap back or couldn't because maybe no signal. You can do a microtransaction to keep the streak alive for a day or 2. Pretty sure people are willing to pay to keep their streaks.

@NicolleDWallace It’s happened here in Canada all week.  The TV says there is no signal but I see CNN is working.  Our cable is TELUS in New Westminster, BC, Canada.  So disappointing when I want to hear what you’re saying and your guests too.

@NevilleRay Well, I still have no signal at work / constantly camping on AT&amp;T UMTS in limited service state at work. Any chance y'all could just let me roam on US Cellular in native coverage? They have solid B12 at my job.
Going on day two with no internet. No tech showed for our appointment. No idea what the status is. No idea when a tech is coming next. So basically we know nothing aside from we have no internet.

I don’t think @theqtrivia will be able to afford the new studio. Premium players are seeing the truth of them not paying and cancelling games with no communication so they are dropping subscriptions. Hopefully they get what they deserve which is being shut down for good.

The whole "no communication and needing space thing" is such a necessary evil.  On my end, it sucks so bad to be powerless.  Waiting to see if she calls or messages.  Not knowing if it will be days, weeks, or most likely months.  The only thing I have control over,  is me.

@KathyONeill9 Last time they hit our communications line (no internet no phone). The phone company tried to give us a hard time but I pulled out that little diagram the locators leave, and that was proof enough for them not to charge us to replace the line.
@ieo_96 @ra_boscan I know it's true iPhone users are like that.  Because they use broken iMessage because iMessage sucks at communicating with most phones.  If iPhone users would stop using broken iMessage and use anything else there would be no communication trouble between iPhones and Androids.

5 hours of no internet. ISP should really tell their customers when they're doing maintenance BEFORE they do it.

@kayyloween This is disgusting. She came to you asking why a giveaway hadn’t been dispatched after a month, and why there was no communication between the customer and you. U were rude. You told her to grow up when she was doing nothing more than calling you out for terrible customer service
@beamiller me trying to text u from my room where we have like almost NO SIGNAL https://t.co/m8S49MJyDr

@OutsiderQuest It had been a longtime wish from our mum to have a Siamese kitty once in her life, and in 1979 when we got Suleika purebred cats haven´t been at the shelters yet, no purebred rescues either, no internet either then... 😮😮😮We had Suleika for about 17 1/2 years...
@conquer0r91 Omg opposite happened to me with Taken. I was expecting a dialogue heavy drama/mystery type movie (I had no internet back then lol) and holy shit it was like one of the best action movies I have ever seen. Also I didn't know From Dusk Till Dawn was about vampires :)
The Spectrum guy has been here for an hour and a half and he’s been on the phone with @Spectrum for like half that time and I’m aboutta go to work so I guess that makes a full week with no internet 🤪
@GanucheauAdam That statement could be entirely true. He could have no knowledge of a communication around 7.6 occurring, communication could have occurred through surrogates, or no communication could have occurred.
@lonesumqueen @VanesssaRenee @loveklarisa I locked myself out of my house with no phone and with panther while my parents were in Canada that was a stressful time 😪
Communication fixes most anything. No communication fixes nothing and leaves things a mess.
I’m leaving for the weekend because no internet cya guys
@Ask_Spectrum Welcome for what still no internet... on the phone again asking for help ...
We are performing planned network maintenance from Friday, Oct. 11 at 9 p.m. to Saturday, Oct. 12 at 6 a.m. During the window, there will be periods of no Internet connectivity for the Westchester campus. We apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your understanding.
I was informed I would need to see a nurse first, and then a social worker and a psychiatrist. I arrived at 11 am. I did not see a social worker until almost 7 pm. I was in the unit for a total of 8.5 hours, no phone, no distractions, locked in with my own panic. (6/?)
@MarieAimee12 @DeanGilkerson @DenCal46 @doogylee @OutIn2020 @JulieReichwein1 @AnBeOnd @kevinjsmith4IT @matosortho @spinster1968 @Tiredofweirdos @StoshAuf @Haicy6 @LynnetteLacy @BonnieGranny They are not helping by turning our power off. Its very fishy, corrupt if you will. Imagine having your power turned off and an actual fire is coming your way. Where will your warnings come from. Our only life line is our cellphones  and in places where I live theres no signal

@BoycottBetfred @paddypower I was on the 45/1 shot for the maximum allowed with PP &amp; BFSB, a whole 250 pennies.  Five days later it turns into 11/10 with absolutely no communication and a minus balance on the account that they can whistle for. Rancid bunch of crooks.
@thegoalzone Bet it will be the same team again next game... That was dreadful. They just didn't seem to bother, no communication, New blood, Hungry players needed. And more than 4 minutes for Abraham.

Can you help me @SpotifyCares? There is not any problem in my wifi connection but not working spotify when my phone connected to wifi . It says on the screen " No Internet connection" . At Mobil Data it works fine.
I spent most of my day off in places with little to no Internet. I haven’t been this relaxed in months.
Most mobile home parks I have bought come with a standard sign design - a 4'x8' sheet of plywood with a faded poorly written name on it and no phone number. This must be a popular design because I see it everywhere.  https://t.co/rR77n0nxmO https://t.co/v9E6YNyj1B

@CooperativeBank Crap 3 days with CB. Cheque missing. Dealt with 5 people. 4 different stories. Money turned up tonight as a cleared balance. So they had the cheque for at least 2 days. No communication from CB telling me they had found it. Coach &amp; horses through their values.
@discobabe76 @stoner1968 @bessacarrali @georgegalloway @realDonaldTrump @BorisJohnson The real aims of what became the EU. Remember, no internet, few ways of getting information to what we had been told was a trading partnership. We were always kept in the dark about it. I told my family to vote out, because I knew about the hoped-for aims.
@PYURcom hi,I got a contract with pyur on check24 on 4.10.I got the fritzbox &amp; turned it on,but i’ve no internet &amp; your app says ‘Your order is currently being processed by us.This usually takes 48 hours’it has been a week already!Can you please tell me when will it be activated?

@PersuasionRisng But you get no phone, no supermarket, no medicine. No Internet. No paved roads. No indoor plumbing. Etc.
@SoaRGaming im poor so no phone / ATT Fiber

That partnership just doesn't work, Maguire and Keane were both marking the same person, no communication
@IngrahamAngle And what good did it do? Fires still burnt. All it did is cause fear and confusion since we woke up to no information, no TV, no cable and no internet. A great way to control population. This was used as an excuse to shut down save cost and still charge for service NOT given.
Just want to say to the world that Muslims are Human also.!It's now 68 days of curfew,No medicine, No food and No communication!Where is humanity?#WakeUpUmmahForKashmir
The cycle keeps on going in Bengal. Killings after killings. Brutal murders of RSS men and other hindus. Libtards laugh over it and still lecture BJP over Akhlaq. For them No internet in Kashmir is Humanitarian Crisis. https://t.co/LUvkNKMzgj
@YodelOnline very disappointed with your service . My sons gaming chair which was suppose to arrive today didn’t . No communication from you until today and it’s only got to Ireland today so won’t be here til Monday . Your costumer service is non existent . Very disappointed kid.
@Jason_Chinsolo Why are you trying so hard to justify that the iPhone is higher than other phones ? galaxy pixel iphone P Y A C SS CC NOTE MOTE MATE It doesn't matter there's no phone higher than the otherYou cannot determine what the average person prefers we humans disagree not copy-paste
@IJohnson_TNF @Dobbln @ThreeUK Massive sudden drop off in reception for me too. Like I have no signal in Leicester Square or Soho, which seems crazy. Turning off 4G helps, I think they're massively over congested (despite saying they upgraded their network backbone for 5G)

@redsteeze His "team" hasn't tweeted since April, they haven't used social media at all. This was bound to happen as there was no communication besides the program with his "team" and the general public on News Events through social media.  @ShepNewsTeam
I’m so mad cause it’s Friday and I have no internet
@FateGO_USA sure am glad we get skipped rewards skipped events skipped banners no communication from the  english team and albert gets to have panels where he announces 2 year old news and takes pictures with guys in blackface https://t.co/KhJXaMsVhY
@TalkTalk So.....the saga continues. Still no internet, most of the time. Works some days for a few hours but mostly doesn’t. Shit customer service on the phone and even worse on the live chat line. Folks, do yourselves a favour and don’t sign up for #talktalk.....fucking shit!
I was trying to tell him that I feel some type of way becasue in a relationship you are supposed to communicate and there is no communication at all with me and this person. So when I was telling him about it today he just sat there like he does not know what to say🤦

timmy thick...emoblackthot....we can really trust no internet personas huh
What happens???I have no internet connection...Unfair!
@tigerator It is a good thing my brother's phone number I was forced to use when I filled out their help issue and said I had no phone number and got a bot telling me to use a phone number to get back in and just said fuck it lasted all two seconds on here.  No issues there and thank God.

Feeling discouraged. Still have a headache, and our internet got shut off this morning because we can’t afford to pay the bill. No internet, tv, nothing. And it’s cold out so kids will go crazy! Behind on our house payment so have to scrape up the money for that first. Ugh!
Hey @Videotron no internet available where I live (Sainte-agnes-de-dundee, Quebec) everywhere else surrounding the area has internet except my area...Is there a plan to add some there? Considering it's the only spot left. It's 2019 and there isn't internet available.

There is no internet beef between me and Fraulloodomodo... even though I can’t stop tweeting about him about how he left me and how he still talks about me... even though I’m tweeting threads flexing on him. He’s still more bitter about things than I am. Because I say so.
Holiday for the week with little to no signal :( progress will be slow

I am taking a much needed reset and will be off the radar until Monday. No phone calls or text messages. Thanks 😀

@Airtel_Ug please fix your services.  Twice this month alone we have been completely cut off communication - no calls no internet; and now, right now, the internet speed is so slow like it's year 2004. This is sick.
It’s a pain having no internet connection at home, it’s the only place I really need it. Taken 20 minutes to post this tweet because @o2 seem incapable of fixing a phone mast. Been nearly 10 days now and you can bet I won’t get money off my bill
@shanerenfrow94 AND I’m sitting in lobby with no phone charger. And by the time someone lets me in I won’t want to leave my parking space.

Think of times the doctor gave up, the nurses told you to try something else, you had no bed, no friend, no phone calls, it was you and that challenge in your hands. Remember only God stood by your side. Faith needs you, teams in all external things.
@ChelseaFC No phone in sight, absolute limbs. Hope no one got injured.
@mosseri Bring back people that were deleted for no goddamned reason because of the algorithm change. Bring back models who aren't famous enough to get away with being pretty since any other celebrity is just fine to post nudes but we get deleted blocked banned with no communication
There’s this classroom where I literally have no signal at all and it sucks because is the only class where I can use my phone and not get in trouble. 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️😭😭

@DKarol @LemieuxLGM @Kathy__Gee The issue had very, very low salience in the 80s and early 90s. I had no position on it at all because I wasn't aware of it as an issue. No internet &amp; social media existed to popularize issues.

@H1TMANactual I think before I was thinking too much in terms of TV and big print papers. But once you brought up the internet (a good thing to bring up), it is a change. If we had no internet, we probably would be fucked and never get the political will.

14-year-old me is disappointed to know that dealing with crushes is not any easier at 45. Truly, how does anyone manage to get anything off the ground? [No, he's not on twitter; he has almost no internet presence. And he's never watched an Indian film. I KNOW.]

@kamos_theory You'll have to send in the Twitter Dms coz I'm phoneless until Lotlrd knows when 😭
Telling my 5 year old that #YouTube didn't exist and that we had no internet when I was a child has opened up a whole new realm of questions. Things like, did you have lights, or did paper exist are questions I am now answering. I've never felt so old. 👵💡📓😃 #FridayFeeling
i wont be as active over the weekend since im gonna be in the mountains where there’s no signal :((
Today had been the best work day,  no signal since the morning and free donuts!! haha might go home early bc there is no WiFi 🙌🏽🙌🏽🥳
Sorry for being so quiet lately. With the start of my job I first need to get used having a daily routine again. Plus, I still have no Internet connection... therefore spooptober is on hold. I hope I can find some time to draw again for this weekend. ;w;'
@9farruk yup i hv but i hv no phone
@JUMPbyUber Awesome. And while you're at it, perhaps admit that you have deliberately difficult to correct incorrect charges. Again, no phone number and ZERO response from "support" via the app.
In the 1940s, you could probably still get away with murder in Las Vegas because there was no Internet, no instant messaging, no advanced security camera networks or anything. That's why the mafia thrived so much building their empires.
@SkyHelpTeam How exactly would I do that with no internet access.

@BunnyAyu @TwitterSupport To have no communication as to why she lost her account is deplorable. Twitter needs to be ontop of these things there’s no excuse

@YahooCare this account is 10 years + old. there is no phone number attached to the account, there is no alternative email. It is so dumb that it requires you to log in with "the device you use most often" why is that even a requirement?
Yeah #Windows10, don't connect to my home network that multiple devices, including the same laptop, never had problem connecting to on Linux. Or connect and show "no internet access" even though I am just using my phone to tweet from the very same network.
@slaveof_allah01 No communication with my loved ones till i don't visit them personally.

I genuinely want to go live in the woods for a week. No people. No internet. Just a tent, knife, bag of food, and maybe a book or two. I want trees and animals and fire and no contact.
@Hendrick9Team Ok no problem. After Hurricane Maria we had no communication with  the states. Having to wait a little for status on Team No. 9 I can wait. Just keep the great job. You have a faithful fan across the water. It it about 96 degrees. I stay inside thank you.😘😘
@Chelsss_B Worst performance of the season so far. Lisa is sprinting into the woods while Dalton and Sydney are just LOAFING! No communication, no plan, terrible executionThis team’s coach has some questions to answer

@JHBWater @CityofJoburgZA  It's with great concern that I notice nearly every request for a reference or update on Twitter from Lombardy East has been ignored today. Only once was a reply given. Yet numerous times residents logged water outage. Still waiting and no communication
@ET_Exists Sad that @isro  lost communication with the lander 😣
@comcastcares I thinks it's too late, I'm home, 4 hours later, and have no internet.  So much for 'we won't change anything without your consent'....

Anybody have an account frozen by @usbank for a few days? Their mistake? No phone calls to explain. Stonewalled at every turn by every department?
How does one respond to being ghosted for a scheduled phone interview? There was no phone call and no email in the last 24 hours stating why the interview didn't happen.
@WeWantTheRealTr @ElemiFuentes @PokerPolitics Hmm... the two different image file formats are circumspect and indicative that they have been taken by two different persons. Furthermore PNG is highly indicative that an image have been processed as no camera and to the best of my knowledge no phone use that format...

@duty2warn #DeplorablesIsland, where there's no Internet, phone service, or mail pick-up. We'd all be spared his shennanigans forever. Should also be home to KAC, SHS, that Steven Miller character, and Steve Bannon, to name a few.

@globalhermit The last show I went to (Madonna at BAM) had a mandatory no phone policy and it was such a great change that I think every tour should do it.
@NearyXCIV No internet for a few days and mother-in-laws cooking?Yeah, I'm feeling that right about now lol
You’re crazy if you spank them over unfriending them on Facebook cuz I hope they block you. Straight up ❌ and then just say we deactivated our accounts it may just be a you having no internet to get around that or no phone which is something I know you won’t do without.
Wish people had less mobile addiction. The excessive usage of mobile is breaking family bonds. People don't talk to each other
Our house has no internet so I suppose I definitely can't do any work. Such a shame was going to finish my whole FYP tonight and write a short novel about hydraulic fracturing

I’m so over being phoneless that I’m ready to just walk into T-Mobile grab whatever phone they have and call it a day.
I’m sure if there’s no ‘internet wall’ in China. More Chinese will speak out the truth in HK also their safety and happiness life in China. Inside of so many HK ppl ‘crying for help like a baby boy’. They’re making sooooo many foreigners to believe the fake news!
I need a a day with no phone and some good energy/vibes. Just enjoyment and no distractions.
@virginmedia absolutely shocking customer service from you. 10 phone calls ... yes 10! And we still have NO internet and NO TV on our second box.... reason for no tv apparently due to the internet however we have another tv working fine ?? How is this? £90pm I will be leaving!
@HealthPakStream :( I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Have you messaged the artists? I think at this point you might need to be way firmer? Angrier? With them regarding a deaeline. 7 months with no communication is quite a LOT and $400 isn’t a small amount.
Sorry guys, I have no internet anymore. I tried my best, but I failed as usual. See you all when I see you.

@EACoreySA Honestly I’m not sure what you expect to happen at this point, 2Days from you and @EA_GZaro and we have no communication, yet that’s both of your jobs? Of course I don’t agree with people sending you death threats etc, but at the end of the day it’s the sad truth if

Sadly we are still with no internet today and probably into tomorrow due to the outages, expect a big bumbo update on Monday!! With let’s plays by me and @jamesid may even get @Danielleorama into the mix soon too!
@excitel_rocks After posting all this shit i still know you are not capable to solve this problem. As your local engineers aren't even sensible at all as they are asking me to sit in the wifi room to surf without any disturbance, so if it is coverage issue why the hell it shows "No Internet"?

He was seriously panicked. 😂 to be fair we had no TV, no internet &amp; were waiting for lights to go out
Come home to find we have no Internet until Monday. 😩 Maybe I should just go back to uni instead??
@happyeasygo You said 24hrs. which have passed - no communication from you people. On each call and each tweet you give a scripted reply. No email of mine has been answered yet by the hotel team. Requested for cancellation 3 days back on call and by email.
I have to go to the land of no internet, I don't wanna 😭😭😭
So, the quiet revolution may actually be the addition of the "No." signal with Lourie as the last holdout.
@unifiedpatents Turns out that back in 1990, several of the other Federal Circuit judges were citing patents without the "No." signal.  Judges Archer, Smith, Mayer, and perhaps others, albeit inconsistently.
@rajeshparikh999 THAT DAY I ASKED THE SAME QUESTION THAT ALSO LIKE REMOVING OF ARTICLE 370 AND ARTICLE 35A WHAT THE USE ANY INDIAN GOT BY REVOKING OF BOTH ARTICLES FROM 70 DAYS THEIR IS STILL 144 SECTION IMPOSED NO INTERNET,NO PHONE CONNECTION, NO MEDIA ENTERING THEIR WHY HM REMAINING SILENT
@soonermagickim No communication to a foreign government goes through without the Ambassador listening in and being part of the loop. That is almost an inviolable rule.  Unless the rule was violated MY not only knew about the demand, she probably delivered the demand. #Diplomacy101
@PCasanave1 Back in my days of service, news was often never discussed. We were kept in the dark about many things. Other than mission and unit continuity everything was Rumor. No cell phones,no internet. Letters to and from home were scrutinized. News traveled slowly.
@MarcAllera @EE what no signal? Limited or no service? Still paying you? Why?#notright #morallyquestionable #downrightrude
Hey @comcastbusiness can you please get it together. No phone no internet until 4:30. I have a work deadline today. Kindly your south miami customer. https://t.co/ZfBgUmRsQo
@UCBerkeley Is the @GreekBerkeley operating? Trying to find out if the concert tonight is still happening and there has been NO communication on this.
@unifiedpatents Judge Lourie has been doing this for a while -- His first patent opinion on the court was In re Mills, 916 F.2d 680 (Fed. Cir. 1990) and it cites to patents without the "No." signal. ("U.S. Patent 4,117,547"). https://t.co/wxNOyqhn8D
@cygnusXXX2112 @southerncagna Without power the rats are going to multiply.  And it will spread. Plus crime.  No power means looting.  Criminal behavior.  With out security cameras.  No phone service no water service.

@ThreeUK Hi. Data signal has always been v bad at London Euston but this week I have had no signal at all until a few minutes out of the station on a train. Is this a known problem? It is in stations that you often need data to most (to check alternate routes etc). Thanks.
@ThreeUKSupport no signal all afternoon in SN6.. why?? #3 #nosignal #Swindon
I have descended out of the darkness..in other words...PG&amp;E finally turned the power back on...for 2 days...no lights, no phone, no wireless service..no pump for our well..fun city...generator solved few problems...so it was an interesting experiment..I missed my twitter-friends
@jpembroke If you have asked and she's not doing it I'd say that is defiance and therefore no internet for a period of time is a suitable punishment.  Perhaps the first time 1hr and increase by an hour each time she is defiant???
@iamlivingdazed thats better tho, u got to experience the whole set no distractions no phone just vibing!!
I was better off in DR with no phone cus man Twitter aint been a happy place since I got back
Theres no internet at the new workplace yet so today I won't be on during work at all!

@laurawritesit Every day after work I get in my comfy clothes and then spend at least 5 solid minutes just petting my dogs in bed, without any other stimuli: no phone, no tv, no talking (unless it’s to tell them how good and pretty and perfect they are). I love my hubs but my dogs are my reset.
No complex voting machine, no internet security concerns, just a simple “X” on a sheet of paper and some members of the community manning the facility. #canadavotes #advancedpolls
@BreedWrestling No phone signal? I'm out
Anyone else’s iPhone absolutely ideas a death since this @Apple upgrade? 🤯 No signal, no 4g 🤷🏼‍♂️
@Snubs If Lava is not a native English speaker, then that's actually pretty good! You still hear the, "it's a phone!" form people over...55, 60ish or so. They spent most of their lives talking on telephones. They had no internet, no text messages, just the phone.
And i just proved how committed I am by keeping honest when we were at loggerheads and no communication at all. Still you doubt me and don't give me date?
When your phone is in the shop and you’re waiting on lunch pickup, but got no internet...you sit in a Starbucks parking lot with your iPad and leech for a bit.
Finally after 9 days of no internet / tv service bum ass att coming smh
@pizzahutdeliver I have no option but to take this issue further with citizens advice now. I've given you till this afternoon it's now 5.25 and no communication from yourselves

Power outage at work, been almost an hour since no internet....can we all leave and work from home?
RIP BT ;( anyone else getting issues? Customer support says there's general issues across the whole BT service today, got no phone or internet.
@liddlegirllost1 This is another effort to limit the ability of people to be able to communicate when the government shuts down all cell towers and internet.  No communication. No organization.
there’s a fire going on here in LA therefore i have no internet for now but i hope others in this area stay safe ❤️
I Really Needa Vacation , No Kids No Phone ... Juss Fun FUN FUN
@VerizonSupport No, it wasn't a technician and our services are not working. Contractors working on the house moved the entry point for the cable when installing new windows. The ONT entered a fault state then. No internet.
@metline @SadiqKhan, @Grantshapps, @CherylGillan , end of week 7 daily failures and cancellations. No end in sight, no communication, no accountability. This week was the worst with severe failures every day. @standardnews

@iGotYoEdges Bad/no communication
No internet at work means work from home day!! Back to bed it is! Jkjk...I never left my bed.
I dislike mixed signals, and will treat them as no signal at all. Be clear with me or be invisible to me.
I’m glad musically I have a team because there is no signal here unless I go outside...would of been so far behind smh
California Dreamin’:  The struggle is real people!  The power was out at my house for 24 hours. No phone/no TV. I had to actually TALK to my husband of 50 years. Turns out he’s a really nice guy! And handsome too! Think I’ll keep him! 😜😘❤️ Have a GREAT day y’all!
For the first time in six weeks I have no phone messages to respond to, I got all my cases called before court breaks for lunch, and the only work I have in the afternoon is to work on motions, GOD IT FEELS GOOD
@talk2GLOBE we have no internet wth
@sardesairajdeep Really even though Kashmiris were living in horrifying and disastrous condition till removal of 370 but even after removal one just can't imagine how they must be living. No Mobile network , no internet , minors put in jail, army men in every street this can't be called normal.
No phone has held its value like the iPhone 7plus
@realDonaldTrump No phone, No Twitter, tick tock tick tock tick tock
@talk2GLOBE Is the something wrong with Globe at Home? I have no internet.

@Etisalat_Care Its not resolved because i’m sitting here with no internet! The technician told us to call ur number &amp; ask for a new router but there’s no answer. We only get a machine answer telling us we’ll get a callback in 30 mins but no one calls back! So tell me exactly how is it resolved?
no internet ! Imma throw myself in the fire
Resetting all 2FA codes in Google Authenticator after switching to a new phone is a major PITA.Use Authy instead &amp; enable encrypted backups.With the multi-device feature you can even access your codes from Windows or macOS apps - no phone required.
I just wanna quick shoutout to @ColourPopCo because I had an issue with Too Faced when I ordered from them for their last sale. No communication from them about my order being canceled until I called. But today, Colourpop sent me an email and reassured me about my order.

I like this idea. Anyway I herby take up the angry Rice Lake Boomer up on his "no internet challenge" on the stipulation he has to not watch TV. No golf. No Fox News. No. Trump. Speeches. Doubt he could make in 24 hours.@creepygnomes please let him know of my challenge. https://t.co/XIvUFoHiQz

When Mark Evich became a bartender 28 years ago, index cards were a tool of his trade. There was no internet to look up drink recipes, so he consulted books and magazines, and took notes on the cards. https://t.co/VvAhNh2l1s https://t.co/V2Nxrl2sLP

When #escorts say “I don’t accept withheld numbers” it’s with good reason. We work alone &amp; every booking carries an element of risk.

@FatimaCawil Best colleague ever. So calm, so quiet. No phone calls or meetings 👏👏👏👏💪
So everything is out around my house. No phone signal or internet
Funny, I thought he was the "chosen one" 🤣🤣🤣Do me a favor, Trumpet, once you've been physically removed from D.C., take some of your money, and buy yourself a private island with no internet access. #NotMyPresident https://t.co/kTlSsKP4By
comcast raised my bill from $50 to $80 without notice for the same service, so i logged into my account and within 5 minutes successfully changed it back to $50 by renewing for a year. no phone call. the telecom industry is so fucked.
Why do I even pay for cellular data when 90% of the time my phone says “No internet connection. Try again” NO SHIT THERES NO CONNECTION. IM ON THE HIGHWAY TRYING TO GET HOME. TF lol
Looks like i will be porting my number. @Vodacom was of no help. An absolute disaster. It's been over 4 hours now with no signal. Do not even suggest rebooting my device for the 7th time or putting my sim into another device.
Everyone is ready to watch livestream but I am here trying to finish all my works. Even if i finish my work I can't even watch it  due to no internet connection😭😭
Well day two with no internet or tv. So this is what it was like in the 1800s https://t.co/6cYDQdGOK1
I got sent on my lunch break at work the moment the vid and song dropped but I have no signal up there because it’s literally the middle of nowhere and I was sooking, so one of my coworkers gave me his phone with signal to let me watch and listen, I didn’t even ask him 😭
Getting really annoyed with the service that @virginmedia is claiming it delivers. Day 2 of no internet. The status says there is no issue. The phone number gives you automated spiel about it been a complex issue. Just get it sorted out!
@VodafoneIN There was no communication of any solution.. a scoundrel of Ur clan made false claims .. I told her I hv proof... I hv d smses rec'd from u cheats n am gonna share the screenshots with @TRAI n @consumerforum_
@KanwarAulakh @RajTayal2 @dngibson2 @EPeeps_Bot @RichardAbben Isn’t it a bit surprising.  LAAO has had a well established registry from day 1.  It is not clear why there is this much discrepancy.  We collect our own internal data for the entire enterprise of 145 hospitals and there is no signal of this magnitude.
@Plusnet appalled with your customer service this week. New customer from Tuesday with business account and still no phone... why?
He has no phone. Then how he shared with Bubloo? Why not trust his brother or any other party leader? Why to share with an Absconder son sitting in London? UK government should be contacted to file similar to Altaf case on him. https://t.co/1FqVi1M2MZ
Like it wasnt a fake accent you can tell when an accent is fake and I have no phone history with this number. I havent even changed numbers recently so how tf did she get my number

@4UWell @PsyLiving Most people don't get enough sleep these days. When I was growing up in the 1970's everyone was in bed at 10:30 pm every night, because we had 1 tv channel and no internet. There weren't as many people working night shifts and so on back then either. Today everything is 24-7.

I hate Mississippi drivers. Here I am, cruising down Jackson when this man cuts across both lanes from the median to pull into a parking lot. No signal, no checking to see if it was clear for him to go, no regard for other people’s safety. Just why?

@sianwils14 @gillinghamjoe It would just think you were at the entrance and had no signal. Clever ones guess you are progressing through the tunnel at the speed you entered it but I doubt that works on a train.

@LuvChildMagick Is no communication to protect my energy a defensive behaviour? I’m not reaching out even though I want to be next to you
@xeni It was markedly different in how we experienced it. There was no social media, no internet. News was by print, radio (none wacko in those days) and 3 TV networks that in today’s standards were similar and pretty objective.
@Bobbieliciouss I was scared I wouldn’t know how to get to Disneyland. (This was when there was no internet in phones) lol
@Simpsongrant1 Punwasi seems to have his small mind made up already. Or no internet where he lives.
@Dina08171428 A relationship is nothing to lose your life for. They will always have problems. The thing is in how you communicate through those issues. If there is no communication it's not worth your time. It's that simple. I'm glad your okay today enough to tell us about it.

@nsitharaman @ANI @FinMinIndia We have a finance minister who is blunt when she was Commerce Minister I believe, Defense &amp; now Finance. Her positive is she listens to bottlenecks &amp; moves in no time for eradication. This is advantage of an erudite personality who has no communication problems to address to.

On the very very slight bright side, having no phone and no access to cash for the next few days means I literally can't do anything but sit in my office and finish my book, so, there's that. And Mrs J has bought me a giant bag of peanut M&amp;Ms, which is why I'm marrying her.

@xeni I was 7. But think about it. We had no internet. No 24/7 news cycle. And Nixon, as bad as he was, wasn't a raging narcissist. My only advice as an older folk is pick and choose your media and take social media breaks. Often.

With no phone/internet, if someone dies on either side of the river, announcements are made on loud speakers breaking the sad news. Relatives then wrap letters wrapped around stones &amp; fling them across the river. If you can’t empathise with that, I don’t know what to say.
@VodafoneUK might be a daft question but never used wifi calling setting before...do you receive SMS through the wifi calling setting? Waiting an important phone call/text in a no phone signal area so trying my luck with the wifi setting 🤞

The reason I say this is because back then there was no social media, no 24 hour news media, no internet, etc., as powerful mediums to gaslight the masses, push propaganda, &amp; instigate more infighting between Americans. Yet, the divide was just if not worse especially w/ Vietnam.
@sven_ftm @LMc10_SAFC @Gav1879 @RokerReport ...personally I dont hang on every word... but I respect what they have done, also suspect they are better business men than me who know more about running a club than me.

@Spuds4Turnip Even your own examples seem to buttress my points. The FCC came into existence in 1934, well after industrialization. Was there no communication before? Has not the FCC limited our communication, by, among other things, deciding which political allies get which airwaves? 6/

@authorcgalvez “Can Do”. My father wrote that in a dictionary he gave me when I started university (no internet at that time). He told me that when we set our minds to things, there is nothing we can’t do. All things are possible. All goals achievable. I think “Can Do” should be our motto.
@bt_uk  Wi-fi not working at home. Waited 7 days for an appt then today no one showed up. Just cancelled. No phone call nothing. No appts now until Monday. Absolutely dreadful service. Will anyone even show up next week??

@brain_bpd I've had to set some boundaries like no phone calls if they are drunk. Self-care sometimes means making hard decisions. Your health is too important.
@JerryCarpente18 There is no internet and the phone lines are down. We can't reach anyone.
@RobynSaysBlerg Have had similar. One medication totally removed with no communication or discussion, another with an altered dose. Cue loads of time &amp; energy sapped trying to find out wtf is going on. You can’t take your eyes off your repeat list for a second 😕
Day 7 no phone – Counter to yesterday: not getting robo calls is totally worth it. Plus, because I’m a ninja, I figured out how to make calls out, I just can’t receive calls; or more specifically, don’t care enough to devote my ninja skills to resolving that.
@LIRR the 738 from CI to Penn was 6 min late this morning with no communication or announcements

@Tofusama Well I'll be there from probably 8-9am soo see if you can come by then. Regardless here's the basics.A train jam from Brisbane to Melbourne, no power, no internet, no data. And make games on the train in 2 14 hour days
@ICT_MrP @GoogleForEdu That's what we've found also. Less than ideal but we'll see how it works. We've a separate (no internet) WiFi set up at the minute. Will need to switch networks before lesson and back afterwards.Teacher iPad needs to download whilst on  main network.
@Spotify If I dislike a song or artist in my discover weekly or release radar playlists when I have no Internet, the songs fade out like normal - until I reconnect, when the whole playlist resets. I guess it doesn't sync? Seems like a basic feature for a premium subscription.

@TheOneWhoChants Start setting habits where you schedule yourself to write every day, even if it’s just 30 minutes. Before you know, it’ll be a routine and you can extend the time. Or, do what @StephenKing does. Go into a room with no TV and no phone and you’ll write your head off.Good luck!

No internet right now ggs
@RizwanSamad1 @AnchorAnandN @ImranKhanPTI Sir, barbaric? That’s a very strong word for no internet access and cell coverage. There is no lock down or curfew anymore. Tourism advisory is also lifted. What’s barbaric is declaring curfew and communications blackout to conduct a cricket match.

@virginmedia So it should be £8 a day after two days of notifying you for total loss. Well there was 9 days of no internet and then a firth 4 days of no phone. So don’t quite know how you guys think that adds up to £15 for 9 days loss of service! (Minusing 2 days for each problem)

@kholofelo_r_ @Heydavinaa_ @oliver_legora My dear, let it go. I did the same too even more than this. Paid his school fees, rent, fed his families, gave him iPhone X when he had no phone, clothed him and he broke up with me. God will reward good women. Don’t let this block your blessings.

@YoItsKeeo We broadcast channels on different frequencies, so it's possible to have some with no errors, while others may have break up or no signal at all. We cannot confirm the cause, but it likely relates to cabling and/or the dish

@virginmedia Bill's gone up again and had no communication to tell me why or even notify me...£72 a month for essentially just the broadband as nothing else gets used isn't seeming worth it now
Safaricom is acting real bad. They’re just like Kplc. No power, no internet or there’s power and no internet. Useless.
@narendramodi @PMOIndia @TRAI  sir good afternoon .. I know you have so many other issue to focus but sir what's wrong with operators deducting balance from his customers by saying you used internet and do Shit but the cellphone I use have no internet connectivity.. @VodafoneIN

Hey @Airtel_Presence @airtelindia -ur mobile data service is catastrophic around both my houses(Jatni &amp; Puri). Though it says that the reception is 4G but in actual there’s no internet at all. I’ve decided to go for number portability and change my service provider immediately. https://t.co/XsV3U3gDYd
Fucks sake meant to have switched internet providers yesterday. But due to a cock up by bt I now have no internet til Monday at least! Cheers for that! Lucky I have a patchy mobile network.... hahaha trying to send this on h+ mobile
@nupuralankaar Why are you complaining now? Kashmiris are in lockdown for the last 2 months. They have no money, no medicines, no mobile service, no internet. And what kind of indian are you? Little discomfort and started crying?You should be cheering for modi and his economic policies. https://t.co/ytLJzs4emj
@VodafoneIN This is what happens in my home network randomly. Phone goes into roaming mode with no internet even though mobile data is configured to connect to data while roaming https://t.co/GZbs8yW1At
@PLDT_Cares Ref# 31587172 - No dial tone since sunday and no internet since yesterday right after paying our bill.
@FabianTijero @scottsantens Like bernie, their plans only affects workers. It doesnt address those who need money to get back on their feet to fix their lives. How can a homeless person find work when they got no phone, no home address, no way to present themselves professionally.
You suffering from nomophobia**Is so uncool

Appalling time with @TalkTalk this week. No internet since Sunday, hours and hours spent with text team and phone team who seem to think sending out a new router is the answer to everything. Think we have a third on the way in the post 🤦‍♀️
@tech4luddites Maybe, but they lost trust. My 5z started showing no signal just 5 days after the warranty over. Asked service center, asking 4.5k to repair and apperently it's quite normal issue for 5z according to the guy in in the SC. Going to get 7t or K20 Pro in tomorrow's sale.
@nuddypants No phone signal or owt.
@virginmedia Hello, it is working fine now but what about yesterday evening??? When I couldn't get on to the Internet. I wasn't happy for paying for a service in which I couldn't use. What is virgin media going to do about it? I work from home and having no Internet isn't acceptable.

@virginmedia Wasn't resolving the issue so she sent a new box after putting me on hold. A total of 4 calls and 98 minutes trying to get anywhere. Now day 2 of no Internet and loads of stress due to the ignorance of everyone I spoke to. Unacceptable
I put my phone in the cupholder but my dumbass didn't see I had my raspberry tea there so I actually DUNKED my phone for a good 5 minutes. So guess who's phoneless now?

@zilla705 @rebeinstein @SusanSarandon I was unaware of this at the time and for many years that followed for 1. I was 15 at the time and 2. Iraq had no internet or unrestricted access to global news during Saddam’s dictatorship. They only showed us what they wanted us to see.

@turtlekiosk Oh no signal works great, no one will use it though.
Honestly, changing my sleep schedule is proving to be more challenging than expected. I normally sleep from about 1am to 10am and I am trying to change it to 10pm to 6am. After laying in bed for an hour and a half (no phone until now), I'm NEED to sleep. #1dayatatime

I'm so confused now if he did cheated on me or not. Coz if not, what was the picture for and why I was blocked?  Bakit kasi walang communication.  No communication leads to relationship decline.  But understandable naman kasi deployed nga sya. Pero bakit nga ako binlock. Ughhhh
So um yeah no phone for like a month 🙂

@irisheyes475 @EmilyFravel13 @StewardshipAmer @realDonaldTrump Connecting with the voters is what all politicians should be doing. We are so used of the "status quo" of no communication we accept it as norm.
i ain't talking hobos, i am talking about folks who have regressed to be animal like, little or no communication skills. they live as the beast of the fields.

@mishacollins Bad time for me to have no phone service. I’m only able to be online because I’m next to my modem. Best I could do is messaging through social media. :(
@YvesDarbouze We live in a country where if what you say is true you can speak about it and try to do something to address the wrong.In china they'll kill you, probably also your family maybe even harvest your kids organs while they are it.No jury system, no media, no internet discussion
@bedwardstiek Yes. It's pretty difficult to get outage updates when there's no phone service or internet. The loss of wages, tax revenue and income for small businesses, in a hand-to-mouth economy, can be devastating for small towns.
@jackiereyz For my 18th birthday I was away on a required religious retreat my high school did for seniors lmaoo no phone and communal showers... they did get me a cake tho

During our time, we had no internet. Tht is why we rarely heard abt such case. But to this kid, we don’t know what’s going on in her mind. It’s her challenge that she live in this era where you can find everything on the net. Talk to the little ones more, they have feelings too. https://t.co/JijvOP26Rd
@Gu_Ru35 @Itz_Sureshm7 @BSNL_TN don't come to @BSNL_TN worst signal;no internet speed.totally waste.

@Greg_Palast Greg, our cable company did this stuff last week. Or so it seems. They claim it was an outage. We had no internet, cable(there is nothing on anyway), and phone. My mother has cancer and she needs to talk to her doctors. Investigate Comcast, they are rotten as hell!
@ACTFibernet Hi no internet since 2 days user I'd ksr193@gmail.com
@wayneadam No communication about where the "official" ride share location is, poor navigation not noting road closures for Fair, etc. Inexperienced drivers are left unprepared and frustrated, riders are left stranded.

Instead of making institutional changes to the admin who covered that shit up they instituted a handbook that says we can no longer hug teachers, be in a classroom with a closed door with a teacher, no phone #s (even tho you need it for the common app), &amp; no off campus meetings.

@cnnbrk What if this is an experiment, a dry run for something bigger, more widespread? No power, no internet, limited cell phones, no ATMs, closed stores, spoiled food, no street lights, limited medical facillities, no street lights and a population ill-prepared. Unthinkable? Maybe not.

Heat on in your bedroom, shower with super hot water and the baseboard heater on super high, and by the time you were done your room was warm enough. Also there was no internet, I was too shy to join my roommate to watch tv and like 1 of the burner on the stove worked.
even if they give my iPod back, I’ll have no internet access for the remainder of my time living here. They’ve also decided that once I’m 18 I am completely on my own and must leave (which honestly isn’t so bad aside from the possible homelessness). Things are fucked right 2/3
We were blessed to not know our parents hoe shit because there was no internet. Next generation gonna get traumatized. lol

@xeni I was only 8, but: no internet back then, no social media, no 24 hour cable news, &amp; only 4 stations on TV. So people only got updates during the nightly news on TV and in the newspapers each morning. So it probably wasn't so tedious since people looked forward to the next update.
@ShayanNabi This rascal says no internet. Then how did u tweet ? Probably someone from Papistan doing or he may be getting signals from them

@DurhamComplete there is a traffic signal warrant for crossings adjacent to schools which is why that signal could be installed. At other places, you need at least 75+ crossings in a given location to get a signal (and if there is no signal, are 75 people really ever going to cross there?)

@AaronWxDavis a CBS repeater for Wichita (our local market) is licensed to Goodland and it's the only one we get reliably. an ABC repeater is licensed to Colby and you can sometimes get that one, but good luck. we have no signal from FOX or NBC
@xeni Back then I got my news from weekly magazines.  Time, Newsweek. No internet of course and nightly TV news was too cursory.And the televised judiciary committee meetings which went on and on.  I watched whenever I could.
@VerizonSupport I reset the unit following the instructions on the page, but now I have no internet access.  It's been 10 minutes.

Yesterday was the longest and biggest ordeal just to end up with no phone. My passport was a piece of piss compared to this shit. Plus side, seeing Counterparts and my new Nike’s turned up today.
@KrysonCJAY Time off and a complete disconnect from the daily grind. Maybe somewhere where there is no internet.
Day 10 of no internet 😭
@BSNLCorporate There is no internet connectivity at 0332627016 for over 15 days.
@Bindid24 Yep so definitely not recording because it’s storming and direct tv has no signal.
You a man then let’s talk face to face no phone then. If it’s pressure then it’s pressure so let’s get it on then.
@ATTHelp can you guys actually help? Unlike the dozen other @att internet employees I've conversed with? Got 2 kids that need some Netflix and got no internet.
@SuddenlinkHelp when you address the outage in Northern California? We've had no internet for 2 days now. Website says there's an outage, but no other info.
@xeni This is tedious? R u kidding? This is a roller coaster ride through a haunted house where a crazy clown keeps leaping out and laughing maniacally!  3 networks and  the AP unless you lived in NYC or DC and NO internet!  It’s was SLOW. Could live your life at the same time.
@puyochron the only pokestop near my home is the welcome sign to my neighborhood... there's also a park, but there's no signal there so that pokestop is effectively useless. pokemon go is not friendly to people who dont live in an urban center,
Y'know what's more scarier than monsters and ghosts themselves?No Internet.

@realDonaldTrump  Now the 🇦🇺Fox feed is completely cut "No signal is being received", but I can get every other channel, including CNN. A*holes. Watching rally on YT. 'Where's there's a will, there's a work around' 👍

@xeni No! It was awesome! I was eleven. We’d never seen anything like this before and everyone was engaged and talking.  No internet so no sensory overload and no Fox News to counter and lie for Nixon. — You “trusted” the newsmen back then and they COULD be trusted.

@FOB1103 @TheQuartering -Like back in the 1970s they had these desk size devices that a legit indie making models could keep going all day, one pot heating while another is being used or holding a different color...But the stores monopolized, the big dogs moved to china and no internet so...
@grandayy @michaelreeves08 hey there like no internet there right 😅
No communication will have me losing interest in a person.
@xeni I was young, but my memory was it was more tedious, BUT...There was no Netflix, no smart phones, no Twitter, no internet, so when the 1/2 hour or so of national broadcast news was seriously must-watch-TV in a way y’all younguns can not EVEN imagine.
Anyone else have one of those special #iPhone7 's with the  manufacturing defect? Dropped my phone off a week ago for repair, still no phone and both @Apple &amp; @BestBuy geek squad refusing to give a loner phone.  #WORST #Apple #iPhone #iOS #fail #Smartphones #geeksquad #BestBuy

@MaddenStore @xenohyt @brian_boss I didn’t get scammed. It just took way too long with no communication and that was unacceptable. I was trying to sell to anybody because my account was going to get suspended for the year.

Lately I’ve been blocking people who seem poorly educated, too young or way limited.There is no communication with them. Skew lines. But they think they’re communicating with me. Kind of like this one demented cat I have. So if I suddenly block you? Don’t take it personally.

@nycbubbles No problem. I have been suckered by some of those cute ads. Learned the hard way. It’s like a fancier Wish. I always google these companies and check their contact info first. If there is no phone number, you can pretty much bet it comes from overseas.
no phone for me broke it
I still think one of the best things we could do w/ DT, his Cabinet &amp; Congressional Rs would be to put them out on the street in different cities in a bad neighborhood with no $, no phone, nothing, just the clothes they’re wearing. I hereby declare myself Minister of Punishment.
@xeni I lived in DC then. No internet or cable tv. We were glued to the Washington Post every morning and spent hours watching the hearings on  broadcast tv.

@xeni It seemed more serious and focused. Of course there was no internet so news was slower. I remember how excited I was the night Nixon resigned. My husband ( then boyfriend) had a softball game and I stayed home to watch the resignation speech. On a 19 inch black and white TV
ME: can you believe this asshole?! no signal, no courtesy wave -  he just pulled out in front of mePORN DIRECTOR: cut!

@almostjingo @TruthEqsJustice They're nuts.  Ham radio even in this day in age continues to be the last line of communication especially during an emergency.  Many landlines today now need power to work. No power, no phone. Cell phones need power to charge as well

@SeanParnellUSA @realDonaldTrump The way he exited, with no strategy, no communication to the Pentagon, his generals or the people that were on the ground was NOT Presidential. Your blind trust in him is not well-founded. Maybe we shouldn’t stay forever, but we should exit with integrity and respect for life.

Women were supposed to get married &amp; get pregnant. That was the only acceptable path. Once this happened she was to stay home and coddle her family. No birth control, no Roe v Wade, no working from home (no internet). It was full stop of paid work.  /3
@newhall89 @JnxOuaquaga @Dawnmillward2 I realize it now but not back then in 1997 when I was 26 and there was no Internet and I had no idea about adoption stuff and had no guide. Now I see her for the weak coward she is (ditto bdad, who told me to go fuck myself) but it leaves me with a ton of rage with nowhere to go.
@enxyXO Still no internet...
@cavsyouthsports @AACSDragons When do u plan on doing the refunds that u sent emails about ? I hope Monday isn’t as big of disappointment as this camp has been so far as we have waited 2 months for it to be rescheduled and us now shorter then was supposed to be and get no communication on anything
@h45zmm @Cristiano @piersmorgan Don’t know that channelBut if I would have known I might have still only now watched it. I took my time for it. No phone, laptop, nothing. Full focus.Not often that I do something like that.
@ThreeUK You forgot the no signal part

@xeni Well there was no internet, so does that answer your question?
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/M9w2j6bSgG What is going on with California? Batteries can run to maintain a form of communication. Power outages, no water, &amp; curfews then no communication? What next?
@brisedete lol surprisingly no. long story but basically I was in a place w/ no signal and then made a joke about how it seems insecure that they're proceeding w/ asking me questions despite me not receiving the verification text &amp; that I could be anyone who stole my card 😂
I have no internet since around 6 hours. WHAT DO PEOPLE DO WITHOUT INTERNET??????
@FarfaYGO mermaid was sexually violented by banlist... It did nothing wrong, No phone call, no email, It did not even know it got ban.
@SassyHealer || That is appalling. Saying that, they do that over here ... or did at one point. The only time I had no internet and HAD to wait, they didnt start airing it til like march
This would have been around my early teens, so 1994 or so, no internet for another year and even then it was a super limited resource. I was SO confused about being attracted to doodles.
@jeobyun @bangtanbisexual that moment when u cant get sc because No Phone Just Android Tablet🤐
One of the women I help is currently in jail and wrote me a letter in desperation. The women are not allowed to exercise, no TVs and no phone calls.  Pretty much they sit on their beds and read and that is it.... https://t.co/Ps0hI8QEnP
Why indeed. As sit, nearing day 3 without power, @PGE4Me so no phone service by @comcastcares and my battery backup for my cell phone is dead. I’m running on fumes with my iPhone. Why indeed? What do elites have planned? Makes you wonder. #californiablackout #RecallGavinNewsom https://t.co/0fvIU0hBZD
So, there's no internet in my house rn, and I have a sh*t ton of homework I have to send to my teachers, life just sucks.
@YoLuchiii_ i miss you sis! im phoneless atm
@PaulinaLanco @Uganda_Rugby @kenyalioness @LadyCranesrugby @BlitzBokke @RugbyAfrique The ceremony, when our national women's rugby team, was flagged off, clears paints a bad picture of the state of affairs in the women's game. The team wasn't in uniform. There was no media presence, because there was no communication. Disappointing.😦
@JohnWHuber That's weird. Cummings is looking at the back of Nadler's head but in the mirror his head is turned to the side. Also there's no phone in front of Cummings but there is in the reflection.
Was that a bought of nomophobia, @SaahoPradeep? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a fascinating idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #article

#Irony on #MentalHealthAwarenessDay as I was out walking my dog, a young white man went by who I first thought was being loud on a phone : "NO. NAH. BULLSHIT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO AIR DROP TO THAT LOCATION! I'M TIRED OF THIS PHONE CALL!" .... BUT there was no phone. #murica https://t.co/f2rj4pcgnQ
It is worse than that, global communism is the target the rich and powerful have slated for all people. Your rich are owned by China, why $, they'll side with communists before you. What we see with China on Hong Kong is just the tip of the iceberg. You will have no communication https://t.co/Ul9vy31yZB
Just had power restored after being without for 36 hours. I felt like I'd been plunged back into the 19th century, and it SUCKED: no phone, no laptop, no light. I did, however, read 4 books in 2 days. So there's that. 😊
@PLDT_Cares 2 weeks total of no internet and bill is just around the corner.. jesus fucking christ..so i still need to pay the full amount right?? This bad of a service should be illegal.
Day 6 no phone: well, I do miss making calls.
I’ve rearranged my office space, still no internet
I am smack dab in the middle of the massive California blackout, and will be for 1-7 days. There's no Internet and thus I can't really write the quest, unless I use a hotspot or try to on my phone. So the thread's on hold.Take some blackout doodles for compensation? https://t.co/oQqkuLuc3z
@CindygOrozco There is no communication!
@VodafoneIreland Would love to know why since I upgraded to gigabit broadband today I seem to have lost my old phone no. and can't connect to either that or the new no. I was given that I didn't want? No phone light on the modem. Girl said nothing about the phone changing.....

@Super_Jase @virginmedia Happened to me on the 7th and no one has fixed it since. In fact, they kept pushing the fix estimate and I'm sitting here left with no Internet at all grr.
This is unacceptable in NYC over 7 hours with no internet or cable.  NYC needs another provider with a true fiber network we need #Fiber4NYC #PublicOption https://t.co/wu6cjbConp

REMEMBER ⚠️ Many less fortunate &amp; senior Americans have no internet &amp; no smart phone. They often have antenna tv or the free/low cost basic cable with 30 local channels. No FOX news, no OANN, just CBS,ABC, NBC. All they are hearing is the left’s propaganda @parscale @TimMurtaugh
iPhone...NOphone....STILL pull....to this day...he’s crazy
we're simply sociopaths with no communication, baby

@YourMorning @CTV @jessicamulroney I love this! What a great idea for a show plus @jessicamulroney has probably seen it all through her experience 👰🏼🤵🏻📺 I would love a redo! I had no internet then!
Oh..also had no internet or cable at my house for 48 hours @verizon Is it really only Thursday?
@xeni My almost eighty-year old coworker says that it was pretty much the same as htis, except it seemed to go faster because no internet.
@_HPooP_ @RollingLoud It’s ridiculous.  After mutiple emails they claimed to ship.  When I look only 2 or 4 things shipped and USPS “cancelled the label” so it never shipped.  It’s crazy they have no phone number!
Have no phone#LouDreSaUKG
I’m getting annoyed now @Telstra - no internet / Telstra Foxtel since Wednesday. No update on when services will be restored. I’m paying for a service I’m not getting.
Bingoboys - No communication https://t.co/XzjjaJgawm
I dont want no phone calls till i come back home!!!
@almostjingo It's extra weird, when you consider almost no one has land lines here anymore and my cell service and internet service are both out at my home right now due to the PG&amp;E blackout.  Literally NO communication available.
Do you ever feel like you lost the signal with God? https://t.co/Miuz0GR9Qv By @YMMauthor
Still no internet at the new place. Waiting on xfinity today then i should be all set to get back on the grind 😭
Day 7, Again no internet. I call @FrontierCorp and go through the process of restarting the router...Its the OP and they cannot fix it remotely because it will interfere with other users in my building. Surprise I received another "Ticket" and apology.
Day 4, Still no internet connection. I call @FrontierCorp and am given another "Ticket " and apology. Day 5, same. Day 6, I finally have internet connection. I text and cancel technical support for the 7th.
Day 3, No internet. I call @FrontierCorp again and and am given another "Ticket " and told a tech will arrive on the 11th. No, I say,    so the earliest a tech can arrive is the 7th. Again we go through the process of restarting the router.
I'm given a "Ticket" meaning my complaint is recorded. Now I'm instructed to describe the lights on the router /motem  and to unplug and plug connections. Still no internet connection. I'm given the standard apology and told to call back if needed.
All seems fine. two hours later no service. I call wait 20 min. to be told it's the OP. ? And they will email me the instructions for resetting router ( I have no internet). Day 2. No connection. I call @FrontierCorp and am told  it's your model or OP?
@Jesus_porvida @Gramma_Nini @PGE4Me I can’t even imagine ... no internet no fridge freezer water .... all the business that have to close for days. Restaurants throwing all their food away 😕 I would urge everyone here especially the ones with “ evil corporations” comments to look into why it came down to this
@CathyReadArt @SteveSouthart Can’t do without a brew! 😂 No phone in the bedroom now. Small steps. I have no trouble getting to sleep at all. Staying asleep is the issue. Off to give it a try now!
Someone cut the fiber to our entire block so no internet for 10hrs so far. Wish I didn't rely on twitch/YouTube/Netflix/Amazon so much #firstworldproblems
Due to construction, the High School will be without power on Monday, October 14, 2019. That also means they will not have internet or phones.  All other buildings will have power but no internet or phones.  Thanks for your patience &amp; understanding!Bri… https://t.co/Bpq8bOnmj3
@after_the_quake @AndrewPoyant @Ward10Monica “Malfunction”...last time they malfunctioned it was windy and rainy too. But of course when there was a gasoline tanker spill, or a major gas leak, or an ethanol train derailment, or a fire at the power plant, no sirens and no communication with residents. Completely unacceptable
@shinjukushug No passion. No.fight . No leaders . No confidence.  No communication.. .. Very Very Sad times for us..
@SailorPika Make sure you have a lot of blankets and flashlights to feel comfortable in the dark! 🔦💡If the power will be shutoff it also means no internet, so we won't talk for few days. Please, let me know when light came back to California again, be in touch! 👭https://t.co/BSo5EApY3v

Bike to no phone tho lol 🤷🏽‍♀️😂
@claroqueteayudo I have basically had no internet connectivity since shortly after noon, in the middle of a busy workday. A guy was sent to "fix" the problem yesterday and instead seems to have made it exponentially worse. Is this really the best the company can do?🤦‍♂️

@TalkTalk You have cut off my internet despite my contract ending on 3rd nov. You will not reconnect it or bring forward the cease order on the line. I am now paying for 3 weeks with no internet connection.
Here’s a scenario, you’re locked in a Supermarket with no communication with the outside world, all you have is what’s in the supermarket. For every week you stay in you get 10k. How long are you staying in there for ??

@cogecohelps hello, I live in Niagara Falls and have had no internet for the past hour. We also had outages last night.
@EdisonTCrux @talesofweirdfl I do nothing but type on it. The no internet is nice, but it has no red squiggly lines to distract you, a small window that makes it harder to edit, and a nice-sounding keyboard that encourages you to pound away quickly to make the sweet sweet typing music.
I sent my phone to get my screen fixed and I'm phoneless... best believe my dad is enjoying this 🙃

@AnimeWifeLover I feel bad for young men. I’m a bit older and was certainly awkward, but it worked itself out because there really was no internet or smart phones..there was much more going on in the real world. I just figured it out after some failures.It’s becoming too easy to be insular.
I should probably bring that high school method of "no phone" till you done with exams on myself😂😂
@DapoDavid6 Can I go with no phone😊
@TalkTalk I don't use my landline so I wouldn't know ,the internet light on my router is off ,but all others are showing as normal,tried multiple devices and all say no internet
Sickening. Another casualty of DC’s bullshit crosswalks on four lane roads. No signal or stop sign here and elsewhere—just a suggestion that folks should yield to pedestrians. Guess what—they don’t.

@VodafoneUK @Vodacom111 absolutely shocking customer service, gave up on hold an hour &amp; 20 mins yesterday, 45 mins tonight. Refused a call back from a manager &amp; still no internet?

@ATT is an absolute joke. They have missed 2 internet installs with no phone call or email notice. Kept me on hold for 90 mins only to give me no answer. This is how they treat new customers, so it only goes downhill from here. Absolutely Disgraceful.

@TimelineAmbush @sonictyrant Ugh. I’m so sorry I missed this. I had it on my calendar, but I was in an area that literally had no signal or anything and I couldn’t get Twitter to load.
@28delayslater @elonmusk For the car to maintain a steady speed and not brake at all, sending no signal to the car that the driver wants it to stop, seems incredibly unlikely. I'm not sure if Teslas are trained to ignore potentially false positives that aren't confirmed by driver action though so 🤔
@GaryMyersNY Everyone is right and wrong, he still has no communication skills.
Ok. Life just got crazier. Now I'm homeless, carless, jobless and soon phoneless. At least I'm not hooked on drugs! Pray for me. Catch y'all on the flipside

@soulohlove That’s what I was thinking kinda. But it still doesn’t measure up to me. Most people didn’t even know cameras existed for decades. Like there was no internet or nationally distributed newspaper idk man I don’t think these were actual slaves

@SinaloNgonyama @DStvCare Yes same here . No signal
Too many biased, twist, one-sided and fake voice. What’s worse? There is no trust, no communication, no even a will to try to understand the opposite site. Tired of this.
Back on Twitter but no memes bc no phone
When your going on a cruise with no internet connection for 8 days you train your best friend on the Alpha Forward launches so you don’t miss the hoodies😂👏🏼 left the credit card # and all @EvanChilds11

@BhamCityCouncil @BCC_Help On this subject, the lovely folks over at @myswiftcard and @TransportforWM managed to send me two of these. Is there just no communication within the entirety of the city administration? https://t.co/PNoMlzmvRV
Quitting onlyfans because the power outages on top of being homeless and having no internet isn't working out for me or my nude business....
so i currently don’t have any internet so i probably won’t stream tomorrow or on Sunday cuz our internet is just fucked and they are fixing our internet on Monday so no internet on Friday, Saturday and Sunday
@DStvCare Can't be it played 5 minutes ago. And now it's done. No signal. No point in phoning your call centre because they give incorrect information and when they realize they fucked up they just end the call
not to be dramatic but having no phone was literally hell
The phone has no signal to play my video, but has perfect signal to advertise the commercial 🤔
@openeir @eir engineer broke internet and ran this morning saying it'd be back in 2-3 hours.  Guess what no internet/tv and back in the queue for an engineer to fix the mess???
