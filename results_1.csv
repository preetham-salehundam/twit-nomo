@XavsFutbol It's about the strategy, Zidane has been playing with the same " Crossing " technique for ages now, it's clearly not working now and he is still stuck on it, the team had no communication just bad performance
@KantosKetchum I speak overpowered mother"Go to your room. No internet for a week."
@KarenCivil @Kehlani Producer @EricGgg recalled Mac freestyling the first half of “2009”: “He did the first whole half of the song in a pitch-black booth with no phone or anything. I don’t even know how he did it, and for it to be so meaningful.” https://t.co/ASpHmfEg3U
@jeremyarroyo @Yankees I remember my dad at the time, with no internet to fact-check, would mess with me by telling me the Yankees were going to trade him because he refused to get a haircut.This wasn't true... was it?As a sidebar... my mom was disgustingly in love with Dennis Eckersley.
You can be in the middle of civilization and you’d still have no signal with sprint. Worst provider I swear 🤦🏻‍♂️
@SkyHelpTeam Last week it went off because ‘no signal’ and the same thing has happened again tonight. A team of people couldn’t help when we rang, all they could do was ask us to pay more money on top of the £83 a month we currently pay,for something that is not working!
I’m really out here with no phone case just raw dogging it
@PlayStation No internet connection
@magneteach @sirDukeDevin Two Hundred and more years ago, with no e-mail, no TV and no internet, the Electoral College made a lot of sense, but today it makes no sense atall!
@Ryanair I understand we can't avoid the extremities of nature somethings. But the complete lack of organisation, no communication, and the fact 44 people were left stranded outside the airport waiting for a bus for 3 hours... Including 2 newborns. That's ridiculous and not OK!
Wow havent been on twitter no phone what did i miss
@sprintcare Over 2 hours and still no phone, what ...a...joke 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 https://t.co/BExAACKwsh
@ATT sure would be nice if you guys did what you say you would do. This in now twice I have schedule to have service turned on at my place and no one has shown up. No tech. No phone. No show and still NO SERVICE! Very frustrating.

@PhillyBobcat Jesus Christ. I'm also on work computer, because no phone.
@itgirljihyo When the boys got accused for pl@giarising the No signal vcr from t0p solo concert, their staff uploaded a pic of that performance on insta and captioned it with "hmmmm.... OUR hard-work"T0p's brother and another member's sister in law liked it. This encouraged VIPs to bully

@washingtonpost Lucky those who are above 40. They have made many stupidity but there was no internet and therefore there are no evidences.
@tomiahonen Definitely no internet or twitter! He will go even more stark raving mad when he can’t hear or see anything being said about him! (Did you notice how I left out the word “read?”) 😂
@Arcaxon @FredInTheKnud Finally! Been wanting an OS with no Internet capabilities and a better than realistic elephant.

@BestBuySupport My laptop is being sent to a service repair center which I found out by email and no phone call to update me on this before hand. I call the store only to be answered, transferred and hung up on, to then be asked for survey on my satisfaction. Are you serious?
@zuninja754 @PlayApex @EAHelp Wow. It is listed in literally every other place except for origin. I haven’t even wanted to play this game because of this. No communication and then finally I’m told just wait for it, eventually it might work out?! Not ok @EAHelp   Not ok.
@AmazonHelp @amazonIN @amazonhelp I rcvd emails that delivery was attempted when there was no phone call/message rcvd. This is falsified communication which can go against the company. You're open to cross validate with your internal comms systems
@AMDGaming no internet, somethin from the Civilization series.  internet, ESO probably.
No phone book in room.  https://t.co/nGvkp876rB not helping me find phone # of an old military friend.  Darn it.  Have the night to myself here in Vegas.
@IndiGo6E you have made a mockery out of your passenger. Because of your on ground crew. Me &amp; My colleague gets to not board the flight 6E-185 even after checking in 3hrs prior. due to lag of no communication between your on ground crew. #worstairlines #indigoairlines #airport
@sektor it gives us signal, if theres no cable then we can’t watch bc no signal KEKW

Sitting in a parking lot waiting to see hot air balloons and I have little to no signal...
@iWilliiam @BenGeskin @91mobiles No phone yet has a smaller hole than the Note 10. And S11 will be even smaller.
Third grade level! For a career politician, Nancy has "NO" communication skills in a room full of men &amp; "REAL" agenda.

@ChoeNut This person pretended to care when I was at my lowest &amp; once I got boring, she said it wasn't fun anymore &amp; she ended  the friendship. Via text, no phone call or anything. This was a life lesson to help me recognize future frauds.
@sonicmeerkat Lol what are you a caveman? Get into the 21st Century grandad!Wait... my phone charge is dying... no phone, stay with me - I must continue Tweeting and get home bef
@NitrateVille I looked into this. No internet here but Comcast, cutting to just internet and adding a streaming tv service is roughly the same price as keeping the service I have, and the cloud DVR services on streaming are extremely limited
No internet connection here on campus so the Moroccan midget, Fatwhale, Monkeyass &amp; Military perps are on the run with their subs getting spots and creating hyperlinks in order to shoot EMF at me which they tried twice at this very moment 150 degrees hitting my right ankle... https://t.co/kbCdT8ZLPF
@joswinson There was no signal to send the email in the ditch. Carrier pigeon only. It'll arrive in the EU in the next few weeks.

INJUSTICE: I've seen racism first hand &amp; today was my 2nd #DrivingWhileBlack for "running 🛑" &amp; "no signal" 🤷‍♀️ BS it was 2 black men that's why. They "smelled drugs". Cuffed them, had me sit in back of car. Found 0️⃣. Was I ok? Why? Because w/ Black Men? 🖕🐷Just sad and angry.
@TwinTemple Exactly! Unfortunately, the key words are intellect and knowledge. There was a time we had to seek this information out. There was no internet. Always breaking down and exploring. It pleases me to do it respectfully. Love you guys! Ave! 😈
@belindagrant80 Sorry Belinda, not today. But I'm here having my coffee now, and then I have to go and pack for a few days away with my parents. No internet access, poor mobile phone coverage, so probably no Twitter. But I'll be with you all in spirit.
SO IM PHONELESS
@KensingtonRoyal Please visit Indian Occupied Kashmir, the state has been sieged by Indian forces, it is a desperate humaitarian situation. 72 years of occupation and since 5th Aug the Kashmiris have no communication, no medical supplies and are being tortured.
@ThreeUK I want to leave your network. No signal or just shitty in general...at times when I most needed it and your customer service is even worse!!!!!!!!
@josayye1 @gvbbylvls @Kkaylahernandex Having a good time no phone in sight, photographic memory more liek
@BrynLaw @ben_parker19 @LUFC @andrearadri @leedsunitedtv @JayMooney86 What's happening about everyone who paid for LUTV today but got no stream and no communication from the club? Nothing has been mentioned.

@VicVanquish Bruh you got a phone. Back in my day rehab meant no phone 😭
@softhiin This person really needs help... and no internet connection..
I woke up this morning in someone else’s shirt, my rings on the wrong finger, hair a mess and NO PHONE. I’m thinking “i lost my phone it’s probably in Mexico already” haha. I just wanna talk to the person who let me get drunk.. 🥴
@JoeUrquhartYEP Just a shame LUTV messed up and didn't work so we missed seeing this, all other celebrations, and lost importantly, the game. Still no communication from the club about it, loads of pissed off fans @andrearadri @LUFC , no word on refunds. @GrahamSmyth @LeedsNews
Did this last night at dinner after teaching. Only seat left at lovely bay-beside restaurant, Saltwater Fish, was corner barstool. Just sat...calmed out. No book, no writing, no phone.

@Flow no internet @cooperage for a week now
So uh about the video. My dad yeeted my phone and said no phone while on the hike so I didnt record anything.... Sorry gamers maybe next time smh
@emileighsrose Bands did a lot of stupid shit in the day to get noticed. There was no internet to beat them down for it. It was all about selling records, not downloads.

@Reuters I like this lady.   She is on the ball.  Not trying to bullshit the American people.  Freedom first.  No  communication with Area 51 .   Wacko’s

Aur mari ex ka connection Ptcl ke taraa ta connect taa but no internet  (no feelings for me) https://t.co/KAl2BMGVIf
@MissAshes92 Glad to hear there is a gate. I haven't passed there in a while. This is a good site for a camera, compared to radar/laser gauges. Agree, underwater gauges are more susceptible to water and debris damage, and thus a false or no signal. You can tie that in to ATX.Floods.
@xSoulHunterDKx @DayZ @NakedByo For them to make it this far. Without the people who purchased the game, they wouldn't be where they are. It's a great game, incredible in my own opinion. But for about a week, it's been in a broken state, with no communication on the situation. Only a sales pitch. Not cool.
@annakhachiyan Somewhere with no internet connection
I can't watch any streams!!😦 I literally have only 2gb of data left... Having no internet is hard!! I have to act like a human! https://t.co/lQ7vOK9MyG

Just thought up of a nice idea for a #Kenshi Halloween mod as part of the community discord event! Will work on it while my desktop has no Internet connection :)
@Asmali77 Kenyans jameni,question/answer and no communication
@snsachinnandu @oyorooms I had the same experience. Booked hotel with OYO at Haridwar and Gangotri for my parents. After reaching there, they came to know that those hotels have discontinued their relationship with OYO. There was no communication to us.
the only people more annoying than exols are 2nd generation stans bc in their time there was no internet so they were fighting physically and writing their drags down in notebooks and now we all suffering from 20th century jokes
chris you said you can be my boyfriend, well: BE MY BF AND LET ME SLEEP AT YOURS NEXT SATURDAY CAUSE MY BROTHER JUST KICKED ME OUT AND I HAVE TO GO TO MY GRANDPARENTS with no internet and other problematic stuff
@mrcollins_o No battery = no phone
@TheCriminalRose It had been months indeed, and unfortunately for them, things hadn't ended in the best of ways.Actually, they hadn't even ended.There was no closure, no communication.He didn't know where Neo had gone to,And he truly didn't want to know anyway. +
I'm working in a pop culture event and no signal of a Madeline/Badeline cosplay, i'm so disappointed
@Shizzle1124 @pulte Yeah i can see that...i honestly havent seen anyone who has won the money...i keep seeing these but never see videos of the winners..no phone calls SS or anything..so im leary of these
Was that a bout of nomophobia, @evolvingTLS? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a great idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #usecase

@TanTran__ @ATT dude..... i woke up devastated because i had no internet
How the fuck did I agree to this phoneless speakeasy bullshit DURING SATURDAY FOOTBALL?!?!?!?!?
@Asameow17 @HeyRhett @kaye_el_bie @kissdeo02 Fans muna.. no phone for ML lol
@BSNLCorporate I guess bsnl is purposefully shutting down the internet in Karnataka, Bangalore, vijayanagar, if I call the customer service they ask me me call some other time, no use complaining in the exchange near me. They didn't resolve my prob. No internet from a week ..
@ladyrelodsalot @elgatogaming It’s not just in OBS though, it was saying no signal, now it’s just a black screen. In OBS and the elgato game capture app.

@AirtelNigeria despite full network signal on my phone, the recently purchased mifi has no internet access barely 2 wks after recharging. The same problem encountered soon after purchase of the mifi. Any solution to this? Many thanks.
@scottros @margaretomara What a great piece! Thanks for sharing. You put your finger on the tensions that most observers weren't thinking about for another 20 years. As for §230, we don't need to excuse misconduct to reverse the Stratton decision. The safe harbor is overbroad.https://t.co/dfw0tln3tK
@amy_tisi Strange that there was no signal eh?
I'm home now It was fun and all but it's good to be back I had no internet there too --"But hey I'm here,I'm safe
Not no texting to make sure i was straight, no phone calls, i mean physically 🖤💯 that’s my dawg 4L
@Hermesparcels have waited in all day for a parcel that was to be delivered between 8am and 6pm and at 8pm nothing had arrived and there has been no communication. This is appalling customer service.
T-mobile boasts having 650 shops. But company is compromised by the lack of service on weekends! They offer a solution to problem - no signal , in 3 days. Big company shit and lack of competence of the Board. In communication services 8 hours is eternity and a complete disaster !
@LucySetonW Just got out of hot bath and have glass of wine. I’ll post some pics later. Had almost no signal most of the day, and got drenched and dazzled so pics not great. We will be doing this again, I’m sure. Xx
@LaurenGermanArg @JaneHil52691644 Hahahahaha !!!You're crazy!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻However, I'm at my parents, in the middle of the countryside, it's so lost that we have almost no internet signal, it is a torture to read your tweets, I think I will have to leave...

@BarbKaplitz @HeatherLinda11 @SparlingAngela Our experience is changes on pain medication and other stigmatized medications often no communication despite no reason.
@iGoBiTima @ATTHelp @ATT @GetSpectrum Probably. Our phone is connected to our internet. So no internet, no house phone. For months we would have times where we wouldn’t have service. It would start with outages for 30 minutes at a time up to the point it would be hours. Just tired of dealing with them.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Yeah. It’s in the basement with a secret door, and has no internet. https://t.co/GMYs8Q02Xh
@virginmedia is there an ongoing issue with broadband in the BD16 area? I’ve had numerous instances of no internet connection over the last week. Your app says that all’s fine with your service, your telephone message disagrees and says there’s an issue...any idea what’s going on
@karlmondon I remember that game well.  Washington was playing.  Back then, no internet, no big weather reports at your fingertips and no clue that wind was coming in the next day.
@Steph73_NL It's possible if it was trying to download an update to the walk that it was stuck waiting in an "I'm still downloading" state with no internet and not visible in my walks because of that.   If it's still not in My Walks, try re-running the app and doing "restore purchases".
@bt_uk I've gone 3 weeks with no internet and was really looking forward to having it again! It's like living in a cave!
@NickHunt7 i cant even do it. no internet😭😭😭😭
24hr no internet connection, enough

It’s funny I saw her at the (kinda) beginning (Lungs era REPRESENT) and at the latest and to see her growth vocals and performance wise was so amazing to witness (sadly I don’t have any vids from the first concert cause I had no phone). okay I’m done rambling
I remember when opening the browser icon on the phone was a big no no. Now if there is no internet for like a minute my phone is an idiot box https://t.co/rleoRQJ5io
Ladies, why do y’all send random pics out the blue after months of no communication.

Thought I was finna die wit no phone
@virginmedia Tried this but it doesn't do anything because there's no internet. Worse still just got back from a 13hr round trip to Liverpool traveling on a virgin train connected to virgin WiFi supplied by the train and couldn't connect with either 4g or WiFi
@IyIaah Thought you had no internet

Immediately you say "I Love you," .....she becomes cashless, phoneless, dataless, homeless, fatherless. All kinds of less!🤣🤣🤣
No phone or nothing like I just want peace
This generation has no communication skills... shit crazy 😂
@Steph73_NL Quite a lot of the routes have places with no internet at all so the app needs to work in no internet conditions.  All it needs is GPS (to be able to see the sky) during the walk.
@DakHarding We're in our rooms with no internet...
@Zuku_WeCare please fix account 871267 no Internet
@AnisTabet23 Only in Lebanon would the people be so disrespected to the point where after DAYS of protests, there’s no communication whatsoever from/about the president
@iwalkc I had my phone crash on me yesterday mid walk. I had no internet connection, so couldn’t reload my walk (no worries, I didn’t get lost). Is there a way to download my walks as a back up? Love your walks and the app!
@YeroTunder Yeah, when there's no internet around and I'm bored as hell 😆
Hate having no internet
And this is why it’ll never work 🤷🏾‍♀️ no communication
Woke up and only 2 notifications? Very disappointed in you people. Go to your rooms. No internet.
@BeSpleen @PamAinsley @kurteichenwald The difference from 1933 to 45 was, that these people were brainwashed by propaganda, there was no internet, no free press and hardly anyone travelled abroad. They believed the Nazi bullshit. Whoever believes the Trump lies and scaremongering is an idiot, a dangerous one, too !

@DrBeniRusani I don't know but we practice this. When we're going out together, no phone.. I mean, we still can take pictures or anything, but we use to talk, or staring at each other rather than playing with phone..
@MilaKunisNow Mila, return my call. Meaning actually pick the phone up and press on the key pad and dial my number so we can actually have conversation. We have been communicating for almost a year now. Still....no phone call! 1347-792-8575 ericaquino411@gmail.com. call meeeeee or email me.
There was no signal on the #PeoplesVoteMarch today. We made it to Parliament Sq due to some crafty shortcuts and heard the result of the #Letwin vote live. The roar from the crowd was awesome!

No communication by the #njdevils. So many lost pucks and battles because they don’t talk and get caught in no mans land. Look so disorganized.
In my ten plus years of using @ATT I've never been so disappointed in their customer service. No internet for six days. No help. No solutions. Looking to @verizon or @GetSpectrum for proper service if either is interested in a new customer.
Day 2 of no internet Still fuckin bored
@ACTFibernet In the evening, I called your customer care where (AGAIN!!!) I was given a false assurance that it will be fixed in sometime but there’s still no internet. Your services are pathetic &amp; stop lying and giving false assurance
@GaylyDreadful No, because I'm stuck in the studio all weekend with no internet 😭😭😭
Y’all I literally woke up at 7:30 and literally walked to I could t walk anymore. Lately myself has been so off of my normal life and routine that I’ve been so nervous. Today walking 7 miles I think I found clarity. No phone, music, distractions. Just me and Mother Nature 💕

@ThePublius2020 I personally would like to hope he doesn't get really sick and have a stroke and have to poop in a bag that he has to wheel around with him and cannot talk and gets stuck in a nursing home with MSNBC 24 hours a day and no internet or way to tweet. That'd be very terrible for him.
@darling_sammy Instead of the phantom vibration in pants pocket sensation, a phantom fleshy hand caressing you from inside your pocket
It's not that I love Android, because I don't. It's just that I don't like iOS. I tried the Ubuntuphone, but as soon I booted the thing for the first time, I saw the complete failure of it. So I went back to Android. It's either that or no phone at all. https://t.co/8WHHgsqzni

@Sidjohnsonnn It depends on when and where, but keep in mind there is zero support on for google fi issues. They will make you reboot your phone, buy new sim card before an "escalation" that takes 24-72hrs for response. That is a long time with no phone number.

@virginmedia No, she couldn’t tell us when it started or when it was going to be fixed. Just that it was due to an upgrade in the area and to call back in two days if we had no internet. And said we could see the outage details on our account page. Which we can’t :(
@lilferebee @chime bank has been down for almost 5 days. No communication from @Chime millions of customers can't access their money. And lots of money missing

@lizethnio6 Basically at the end of the day they all need to talk, and they will very quickly. This isn’t gonna be another Escort where there’s no communication. There will be certain things left unsaid for now, but from this point forward they’ll be pretty open and honest
Could you be without your cell phone for the day?  High school students and staff members at South Jefferson proved they could as part of “Phoneless Friday.”   https://t.co/2CJffby0po

Hey @cashapp ,How much money do you really save by not investing time and resources into @CashSupport ?No phone line? 48 hour email responses?Increase the transaction cost if you have to, this lack of support is a huge turnoff.

@Stillberto One of the most frustrating things about the way VAR is currently used is that there is no communication of the reasoning behind decisions. I would love to hear the conversation between the officials that resulted in that penalty not being given.

I saw a guy at Starbucks today.No tablet.No laptop.No phone. No lights. No motor cars.Not a single luxury. He just sat there.Drinking coconut water.Like a Robinson Crusoe, as primitive as can be.

@DaveVescio @BrandonJRouth @StephenAmell  That reminds me of this: “No phone, no lights, no motor carnot a single luxurylike Robinson Crusoe,it's primitive as can be.” 🤣🤣🤣
My favourite thing to do at the moment is go out with no phone like I used to, back in 1995, cos the phones were huge and cost $2 a minute to call people. Or if I do, make sure it's only at 10% power so I only use it in an emergency.
@Scala9111 That was two hours ago. No internet lol. We just landed! Thanks!❤⚘

@JioCare see this. We love Jio. Jio has revolutionized the telecom sectors, we should admit this. But still, I believe in Jio that's why I haven't ported my sim to other telecom.

Having no internet connection and to joke about it as a 1st world problem really bites you in the ass when you are at the receiving end of that joke. My entitled-self is internally screaming, no doubt.

@OpenreachHelp Hi Openreach attended my home on Wednesday to connect phonline/internet, was unable to connect due to external fault. An Openreach engineer was booked via EE for yesterday to connect my internet/phone line in N22 8DN. Today, I STILL have no internet/phonline.

@ThePublius2020 Trump doesn't need any books. He gets a television with two stations: Fox and RT. The internet with access to only Twitter. We want to be able to read about his brilliant thoughts.  No phone. A nine hole golf course with boulders strewn about and day old fast food and Moxie.

@dorydebby @StinsonHunter Suppose it’s all about trust but if you’re in contact with him then at least there’s communication so that’s something. When there’s no communication then u have no clue who’s there or what’s happening.

@BanKsEsports most importantly there was no internet to spoil the whole thing
@cbschicago I really wish you would address the issue on why #CBS #CBS2Chicago is the hardest channel in Chicago to pick up with an antenna. I had finally found a antenna position to get #CBS then we had to rescan all channels. Now the channel name shows up but still no signal.

Actually more nervous for this match because I’m not going. The annoying thing is, I would be going if my parents weren’t on holiday. Now I’m stuck at work with no phone between 1 and 5. Well at least when I finish the game will be over.
@KeithMillsD7 @Donnachain22 there is a conscious, deliberate &amp; sinister policy to sneak in hundreds of so-called 'asylum seekers' under dead of night into small villages around Ireland! No consultation, no communication, no choice!
The recent mess at @ThreeUK finally pushed me to move to a different carrier. Months of no internet in town centerMonths of adult filter blocking things even though it's offDozens of times on the phone with supportLasw few days were even worse. Bye @ThreeUK Hello @PlusNet
@SKYserves we have no internet connection today. Please check
the train passing a village with a pretty clean small river. i saw a grandma sitting on bamboo bench while the evening wind breezes softly. the other women washing clothes, bathed their children or simply just sit down in the edge. no phone in sight, just people enjoy their time.

Last two days there has been no 4G Signal - it’s almost 2020 and there’s no phone signal. Wondering how 5G will ever make it here.  @EE @legoland @cadburyworld #firstworldproblems
@sextoyspolitics I just went upstairs to watch it, it got like 30 seconds in and now it's stuck on an infinite load. Sometimes the internet here just doesn't work right. It's totally rediculous but it's this or no internet.
Bro is currently tweeting while crossing the Rajang river who says Sarawak has no signal pft
And again.... now I’m told @VodafoneUK can ONLY REQUEST! An engineer AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY meaning that I’ll have no internet for at least another 2 weeks! Because @WeAreOpenreach are actively not doing the reactive works for @VodafoneGroup
@SkyUK Months with intermittent broadband connection. 4 engineers. Hours and hours of phone calls. 22 different people telling me it will be fixed. And guess what. I wake up this morning and still no internet. Sky you are a joke. Equipment is going in the bin.
@loveshoeaholics supposed to have a delivery yesterday - nothing delivered. What’s the point of paying for next day delivery if it’s not delivered &amp; no communication 😬. Second time contacting with no response
@ThreeUKSupport still no signal what is going on
@peter_lord @tom_newton1234 @MartinRemains On the previous 2 marches there was no signal most of the time because everyone was trying to tweet. That, and people getting in the way of my bandwidth. 😂

Was that a bout of nomophobia, @XiuanL? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a nice idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #usecase
Hopeless customer service @asianetcabletv after upgrading to your digital TV I am suffering from bad picture quality, no signal issues everyday. Why am I paying you anything...last 3 days no cable even after making 10 to 30 calls to your customer service.
@ThreeUK so got up this morning and had WiFi calling in my house - took phone with me outside and came back to ‘no service’. Phone is useless without it as no signal in our village - please get it sorted!  Done all usual fixes ....

@Rumlino @SurbitonMoan @EE The whole Surbiton no signal, problem with a mast. #EE not in a rush to fix it
@MJairosi No signal is needed to be given to start the rebellion. Spontaneous reactions from people all over Zimbabwe will do. If you organise a date and place the junta will counter and put security or even ban. That's the reason why at any hint of protest police are thrown in the roads
@bt_uk Hi Paula, the pic shows what I should be getting (100m download and 10m upload minimum) My internet keeps dropping with no internet for hours at a time. Last night I had no internet for 6 hours.

@ThreeUK Please help me out here, my phone still has no signal despite turning it off and on countless times. I've even traveled from the I.O.W to Surrey with still no sign of any signal. To add to this, my three phone number was meant to be transferred from my old three sim
@DXdelivery for 3 days I’ve had my delivery booked in and promised within certain time and each has failed no communication. I have to collect from you today as I’ve stressed multiple times I need it this weekend. Shocking service!
Y’all be thinking cheating, lying etc are the reasons relationships end . No inconsistency, no communication, changing up how you treat them, not giving effort and more are also reasons and y’all don’t get that . https://t.co/6qLJir2o6H

@janemerrick23 Agree.  I remember being totally cut off in the countryside, no phone, new much wanted baby, pushing the pram along the unmade roads crying, everyone thought I was totally in control, organised and on the ball, mums must speak up, can have lifelong effects if they don’t ❤️
@nobucchika THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ME AND KEN ARE LEFT W NO INTERNET DURING THE DAY WE BECOME ACTUAL ANIMALS
@selfawaresoup @la_mafaldita Ever travelled from Munic into Austria? By train (DB...😭)? There is virually NO internet reception before crossing the Austrian border, except when finally reaching some town. But, as soon as in Austria, zack, 4G (to be fair, nothing in the tunnels on the Austrian side).
@DoT_India It's possible to Get UPC CODE for my old AIRCEL Number But unfortunately there is no signal is displaying but I need that number
I cant win.... finally got power back. Sti no internet. Woke up feeling like death. Sore throat and head ache and cough. Kill me
@shaunamkinney I used an online retailer from that area, and it took a week for my order to be dispatched. Almost no communication from them.Never again. shaking my fist ;-)
@iamanandd @naukarshah You are diverting the issue by taking it to a personal plain. Even if my mobile phone remains blocked, I shall not be silenced. Read the history of our freedom struggle? There was no phone, yet people protested. You people are indirectly helping two-nation theorists.

@licindiaDownloaded LICPayDirect app and tried it for an hour to pay a premium but failed as the App continuously showed lack of internet connection.If there was no internet connection,how could the App was downloaded and this Tweet posted?Is your App a junk joke on customers?
Wow @VodafoneGhana my broadband stopped working last night (second time this week)  and I was forced to sleep. I wake up and still no internet? Please give me back my internet, I paid for It.
@VOXI_UK thanks for screwing up my order! Despite my following instructions, you have transferred my old number to a sim that I don’t have 😡🤷‍♀️ and now refuse to transfer it to the Actual Sim that You Sent Me. WTF?? I am now meant to have no phone service for 3 days??
we're gonna have no signal once we get to the march on account of how many people will be there; we're counting on Remainers back home to spread the word for us!! 💪🇪🇺🇬🇧 #PeoplesVoteMarch https://t.co/JAnPI7kkwp

@Dorns84 Just staring at the side of your bonce. No communication 😂😂😂 final whistle goes “right, how is everyone?”
@IndiaPostOffice Went to post office yesterday. But as has been the case, no internet banking for my existing account. Thrice it has happened now, and twice after you have had given clear Instructions.
@colettebrowne People in communities have concerns, some of them legitimate, some of them based on ignorance, some of them abhorrently racist. Common theme seems to be a vacuum of planning and no communication plans or integration investment/plans from government. This needs to improve
@SafaricomPLC  why no internet access?
@helpmeunifi why still no internet? And expected recovery on 25/10/2019? https://t.co/q3mUKKhXOX
Terrible biz team. No contact forms, no communication. Just some punk in San Fran cancelling stuff with no explanation. Not reading 40 pages of confusing TOS because I PAID money to SUPPORT your business YOU accepted after analyzing my account. Money back!@TwitterBusiness https://t.co/Jok8RDgz6D

@SLTchat @andysquires1 Looking forward to this. Moving from a BYOD school in the US where phones were everywhere and we proved WiFi to students to England where phones are “banned” in classrooms and bad/no signal was a huge culture shock.

@DevilishDanni @instagram Well it's early days I suppose but no sign of anything just yet, wouldn't surprise me if no communication. I've emailed them, contacted them on here and Instagram itself. Time will tell
No electricity, no water, no internet  the whole day yesterday.  It gave me an opportunity to spend time with my family, they are actually very good and nice  people 🤩🤩#Zambia#LoadShedding
Succeed with no instagram for 2 weeks and now i was thinking to get this nokia phone so that i’m away from this socmed/smartphone thingy. But, sometime i was thinking its better to have no phone at all. #JustSaying https://t.co/yOmPNHL21M
Ugh. I have 3 days left to make this money or no internet. I'm just realizing this NOW of all times. Pray for me, I think sleep no longer counts as an option if I want to keep my internet on 😭😭😭 #help
Fuck me no signal for days actually about 5 minutes before saying oh you want it THATs the way forward.
@Bluestockingmum @woofit79 @BBCNews They always do. It's just normally we're all on the march with no signal.
@goibibo Your customer care agent raised a ticket and asked me to respond to the same email with files from my end (which I did). It has been two days now and there has been no communication after the initial phone conversation. How do I proceed?
@ACTFibernet Very bad service.  More than 30 hours no internet in home. Ticket No:SR10331469088262  . Almost 1 or 2 days in every week, I am facing internet failures. If this is the situation, I have to disconnect your services.
Not having no phone a different kinda ass

@VodafoneUK 11 days in total and next to nothing has been done. I get promised phone calls when things are done, but no phone call. I have to chase. Yet still nothing has been done. Poor customer service and I’ve tried complaining but heard nothing back!! Please sort this ASAP!!
@fuckkillyou2 Bro, i have no phone, im not using whatsapp anymore
@VodafoneIN multiple call drops! No signal!! Cant even get thru the 111 Vodafone care number to complaint!! Whats the solution??

@Sinkopedia I (and you probably) grew up as the internet became mainstream. We are all still adapting and only certain lines have become obvious, like no social media for those under 18.That said, porn blockers and a curated internet for those under 18 is understandable. No internet is not.
no phone for 1week
No communication, lack of loyalty got me dead ass lol
@SpotifyCares horrible support expect me to do their work no phone support
@Reignstradamus I looked it up and I was thinking of Green Bank, where there’s no internet cause they don’t want interference with Government Telescopes, my bad

I'm currently in an area with absolutely no internet, except for my mobile data I'm using to download #AHiTSwitchI took this into account just in case; I've been well prepared for this to be a reality. I have to go now so my Switch uses up my internet data and not Twitter https://t.co/zlTITcKKdp

Brenden Knox appeared to have scored on a 1-yard run, but no signal...it's ruled short. After play, Isaiah Green whistled for an unsportsmanlike conduct.Play is under review to see if Knox scored before penalty. If play stands, Herd will have 3rd-and-goal at 15 due to penalty.

@nuency25 @ClimateAudit @JupiterWalls @ombudsman4truth @sunmaster14 @ProfMJCleveland @HansMahncke There is no Presidential route for surveillance on US Persons, it’s a myth. That is for authorizing surveillance on enemy facilities that have no communication with Americans, so like a Russian Navy base.
Same is happening with me account no#1145374633, @HathwayBrdband  your network sucks..for last 10 day there is network issue. Either there is no internet for hours or when it comes it gets disconnected very soon..using @JioCare or @Airtel_Presence  hotspot for internet. https://t.co/ly4q5pZxHH
@trey_sheppard @shadxjose Bruh . Smh no phone or nothing
having no phone is really ass
@WizardWhistle No phone is more durable than another tbh. Put on a tempered glass, use a good case, and dont bring it near water ever. Phone batteries will always degrade with time/use but the Note 10 battery is the best out of these choices.
@pammy3006 agreed. Just a term created.  The old days was no phone call returned.
Let me just hop on lea- oh yeah, no internet Let me play smash onli- haha...Well I’ll just watch some ani- fuck

In 1999, NASA lost communication with the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter. A contractor had written a program for the orbiter using imperial units, as is standard in the U.S., but NASA’s software used the metric system. https://t.co/CiIgbjHHZM our @charles_duan in @Slate

@VZWSupport Both. Some places outdoors we get no signal. Same with indoors. Dropped calls, no service, etc. If we move to certain areas in the house, we get at most three bars. It’s been going on since we have had smartphones-years.
@OptimumHelp I AM REPAIRED! KUDOS TO EMILE! HE WAS HERE ALL AFTERNOON! How do I get a credit for all the time that my service has been going in and out? Almost 2 months! One day I had no service, the next day I had tv but no phone or internet, the next it was vice versa! Two long months!

What is the thought process whereby a person decides to text another person they barely know after 4 yrs of no communication? Do ppl just scroll through their contacts and randomly text ppl? I'm curious abt this but not curious enough to respond to the random that just texted me https://t.co/69Q2B3AJH0
@pulte @PulteDaily I might be without power and all contact if pg&amp;e moves their shutoff line even half a mile, no phone Wi-Fi nothing. A cheap hotel for the weekend would be a blessing

@aurajinallamour Exactly!!!! I always told myself I would never treat my kids how my mom did us . There distant love and no communication in this house . It's so crazy but I've grown out of having feelings towards that it literally doesn't effect me anymore . Sometimes you have to grow up before

#DanfoNigeria’s symbol of anyhowness.The buses have no signal lights or mirrors. They always look beat-up, they deface our roads. Everyday, someone is bashed by a danfo. The drivers are not licensed, you can’t do anything to them. But everyone is just causally ignoring. https://t.co/P1xNr8IHjt

@AmazonHelp Fire stick is plugged into TV and power power source (wall). TV set to hdmi, no signal. Fire stick won't turn on. Power cord was tested and is fine. Hdmi adapter was tested and is fine. TV hdmi port was tested and is fine.Seems the issue is the stick itself.

@Tesla ...with repeated followups till 10/23, i was told there was no loaner available and on 10/24 all followups stopped from SC. No phone calls were returned to me either. Is this how you guys treat customers who spend a $100 Grand on a car, you should be shameful.!
@_heylauren Worst part is no communication from the devs at all at least address to the community you know of/ are working on the issues or if they feel like it is something that they don’t want to take out the game at least tell us so we all don’t have to tweet out the same issues :(
highly considering going phoneless 2020

@PurolatorHelp No card...no phone call...please examine how I'm suppose to know I have a package in!? Most times I don't even know which courier a company is shipping to us with. I have to run all over town trying to find my packages. I will insist on companies not using Purolator to avoid this
Week two with no phone and it’s been a struggle
@PurolatorHelp There was no card. So no card, no phone call. Am I suppose to be a mind reader?? 2 WEEKS IT WAS THERE. So I finally go get it and with my back out, carry the 70 lb. package up the stairs.  If this was the first time this happened that would be one thing but it has happened before

@VZWSupport I have no internet service and can only get one or two bars. I was bumped up to another rep who assured me that verizon wasn't throttling me. He had me swap out my Sim Card, but that didn't aolve the problem. This has been an escalating issue for about a year.
@paul_winginit It's great no phone signal you can relax. Nothing reason why i like not having WiFi on flights not forced to check my emails
No internet since 10am TTuTT/So most likely there will be no stream tonight, might take this time to doodle or try not to get sick xbsjfbna

@sarahzj one of my favorite things on business travel is to sit, silently, in my hotel room. no phone, no television, no music. just silence.
When you crack your phone screen and @USCellular says they will overnight you a new phone: 😊When its been 5 days and no phone so you call back and get told "oh, they didn't tell you they were backordered? Our bad. We don't know when you will get one": 😠 Thanks USCellular 🙄

Nothing makes me feel old like hearing my husband explain to my daughter there was no internet, smart phones or Netflix when we were kids.
Over 50+ days no internet and today was our drop team appointment and they no showed. Again. For the third time. How is this an escalation @TELUS @TELUSsupport ? I think you’re lying to us. How does your drop team no show 3 appointments in a row and over 50 days straight?
I can’t with ESOL students man😭 one goes to his friend “Thor fono signal ar ni beh amar tath ‘no signal’ aya boythakseh” 😩😂😂😂

@SonicTelecoms Hi Sonic, less than 48 hours into a new Contract with no signal. I want out now. Please come and collect your Installation materials.
@sebas05000 @ari_bloch @JohnLegere @NevilleRay Typically poor quality SINR and RSRQ I suspect are the issues in this area.  Looks like T-Mobile must be actually working on it today - no signal from that site.. but typically getting 3/5 'bars' from a site up on the hill.  Overlay in this area may be the key.
glad i don’t fw no internet ass nigga, y’all be embarrassing yourselves on this app

This ain’t no phone plan when I put my brothers on
@AITA_reddit YTA, she has literally no idea why you’re acting like this due to no communication of past feelings of any sort. I’ve had a few guy pals I was close with from hs I tried to reconnect w/ that were rude n cold to me, most likely cuz Im married now. Friendship ain’t enough for some
@Ask_Spectrum so 5 days no phone or internet in Charlotte NC for me and my neighbor's. Is there a reason for this?

Dear #RealEstate industry,You really need to start putting the ISP's available and the internet speed packages available where a house is located. It's just as, if not more important, than the school systems. I wouldn't move to a house that has slow/no internet.
@SunTrust Hey Suntrust fraud department , when I disputed a transaction 2 weeks ago, and now you finally decide to fix it, how about letting your customer know you shut down their debit card instead of letting them find out in public.  No email...no phone call...you suck.  0 NPS.
Is Victoria's Secret an alternate dimension, or something. That's what it feels like. And there's no signal in here, but there is everywhere else in the mall.

@RiotL4T3NCY @Mortdog Turning a team score of 2-14 from complete loss, tilt and no communication into a team that worked together in the end. Myself and 2 other members remained positive and gave our all, eventually the others followed, this game promoted me into platinum for the first time. 👌🏼
There’s no signal in this bitch
@selenagomezsax @selenagomez Cape Town = Load shedding = no internet connectivity😭😭
@mattliebowitz @ATT Seriously, though...all these years, I've been paying ATT for "Cell phone service" while all I've had was the grace of broadband service??? No internet connection, no cell coverage. What exactly was I paying for?

@DaddyHoggy Had to get it working on old laptop XP SP1 with no Internet connection. Took perseverance &amp; about 3 hours.

@R0zzyB0wden @JuddLegum It’s not just Facebook. It’s the dominant cyberlibertarian credo of Silicon Valley. Barlow published the playbook back in 1996–The Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace.

@bt_uk Already ran the checks and it’s an issue outside the home. It says estimated fix of Wednesday, no internet that whole time?
Not only is government NOT the problem, it’s actually the only tool we have to combat the largest problems facing man-kind. We can not tackle things like climate change, poverty, etc.. without it. Without the government there would be no internet, GPS, society as we know it.
@martolinakiwi @LATAM_PER I'm in the same line. Since 10:30am and now 2:49. No communication from @LATAM_PER to passengers in line. Safety is one thing; customer service is another.

Received an email from a temp agency last night for a great short term assignment. I replied with my updated resume &amp; availability. And then today...nothing. No email reply. No phone call. You are a piece of meat to temp agencies. I got my hopes up for nothing. Feeling the sting.

Really bummed my @JeffreeStar halloween mystery box got cancelled somehow. Went from having a pending charge on my bank account to not having a charge at all. No communication about it either. :(
@CSGOEmpireV2 @sync1080p @_Sliced_ Yeah it's a learning curveball with this CS system but yh your system will improve but your customer service to high rollers won't improve and communication within your support team. When I worked for you for two years it was really disorganized, no communication between teams
@SKYserves Youre testing my patience again. There is still no internet as of this day! Location is not even on the list.
@NeedsAManDuh_ @_sabrinalana_ @lexitherealone @saul_rubio10 @RashidaZakiya @gabbshyphy @xberryhes @kyleeeeannn @itsthahope @keIseazy @LandonBagby @siimplyjayy Okay so.

@gram63 @BBCRadio3 *runs up and down boat hysterically at the thought of no internet...again*
@IndiGo6E our flight (Bombay to Delhi) has been delayed. No communication and heads up given to us about this.
@_woollyback @RokoshME @united_roll @Lumberist So although I see the need to reduce, I also see that we are improving. If you want to help so desperately you might want to look at what you can do, no internet, no phone, no fridge, no runners, no synthetic fibres,canoes, bikes, trains, cars etc! We still need to live
This guy just cut in front of me w no signal and then proceeded to go UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT WHY
no phone really got me out here communicating with people on this old ass pc.....oh man 😂
Things I like and dislike about Night Shift Like :Less people to deal with No Managment Dislike :Little to no communication with coworkers and boss. Little to no resources.
@virginmedia  absolute disgraceful service and appalled for any customer. No internet since 7am, 3 phone calls later in excess of 40mins waiting and the resolution is a new hub to be delivered. Shock can’t get it until Tuesday. Looks like SKY @skytv_ is going to get my custom
@kohiyote when the day comes where I need to look at furry porn in a Target with no phone data, I'll remember your brave words
@SMARTYMobileUK @ThreeUK so I had no signal from 2am Thursday morning till 8pm Thursday night and I’ve had one bar and 3G since. Paying for something that doesn’t work 🤦🏼‍♂️ https://t.co/rXhrkjOy5z
@paul_winginit You can’t get a signal because of the train or because no signal even exists outside of the train ?
@_thedrrew Live the life! No phone, just a couple mfs living in the moment 😂
Put my order in for fibre broadband with @VodafoneUK nearly 6 weeks ago! Was meant to go live today (for the third time) but surprise surprise... still no internet. Steer clear. #fibre #broadband #internet
The higher education system in the UK is a joke. No support, no communication, completely elitist. I want to learn and grow and go on to be qualified for my dream job but it seems like an impossible task unless I suddenly win thousands on the lottery🤷🏻‍♀️
@dhh I stumbled on them while searching for a sketchy guy I knew 20 years ago who has no Internet presence but apparently a couple of DUIs.I paid them $1 for the 7-day trial membership and canceled it right away as it seems they won't actually provide the extra info they promise.

Before the communication shutdown, things were looking up for young Kashmiri entrepreneurs. Now, with funds drying up and no internet, more than 100 startups in the valley have had to put the brakes on their dreams. https://t.co/AvAEqTAN5P
@NippySweetyLass Yeah, but there's no Internet in woods and therefore, no Twitter for him to throw around his wisdom...
There should be no phones so you don't bitch why there is no faculty in your deptt. There should be no phone so you wouldn't shoot what ABVP does in your campuses. There shouldn't be phone so you don't post your grievances with SSC on twitter. There shouldn't be phone at all.
@Walmart @Apple to the labs or hire labs to find the problem or better yet constantly check whether their are loop holes were china or usa ir havkers can penetrate it also when power went out in northern cali i found i had no wifi no phone no lights how will thst work

@phattuck @drawandstrike @drawandstrike jinxed it. No phone book, no action.
So we’re $100 out right now, and have had to deal with no internet, a rude @BestBuy employee, false claims on @NETGEAR s website, and just pure frustration. This week has already been so emotionally draining and we really didn’t deserve to have to go through this.
@VirginMediaIE No internet access on my WiFi (again) and your customer care line is constantly engaged. Explanation please?

No communication, no updates, and then no help with flights the next day. Cant see how they didn't see the crew issue potentially being a problem - could have allowed passengers to make other arrangements earlier. Pretty dreadful 2/2.

@robreiner @jenelr I totally agree. On a less serious note, I could hear Archie saying “They don’t impeach a president over no phone call Meathead.” Carroll O’Connor is gone on but I can tell you AllIn The Family was the greatest show of all time. No one could play Archie like Carroll O’Connor.
@ATTHelp my technician has not showed up to my scheduled appointment with no phone call. Glad i took off work...

3. Morning routine. Wake up, meditate, cold shower, no phone usage, journal &amp; hit the gym.
Interesting how things come to a halt when the internet is down. Heard someone crashed into a major wiring hub and they don't know when it'll be fixed. No internet in an entire city. Fun times.
@johnsolomonbain @ToryAmerican @QueenSeraphine I lived a good part of my childhood in a farm back in Ukraine. Life was hard as hell for my grand parents who lived there, especially during the winter.

I Honestly Need A Break From Reality and everyone ... I’m talking bout no phone no nothing
@theingthing In this instance, as the customer is on the edge of that cell, network service deteriorates and can result in intermittent service. Naturally, if both the primary and neighboring secondary cells are powerless, there is no signal at all.

@VodafoneUK what happens when you guarantee a date for broadband connection and fail to deliver? Asking on behalf of a family member who’s been waiting over 5 weeks now. Is your ‘guarantee’ meaningless? And no they can’t message you personally because they have no internet!
@OpenreachHelp 3 weeks and counting of no internet at our new address. How hard can it be to get an ENGINEER TO SHOW UP. They say moving house is one of the most stressful things you do in a lifetime, well you have added to that ten times over. Thanks, truly.

@ABC7Chicago Rescanned on my TiVo Roamio OTA this morning.  Problem is that the TiVo now has two Guide entries for ABC7; one (WLSHD) connects to the new broadcast signal but all Guide entries are "To be announced"; the other (WLSDT) shows the proper programming but has no signal.
@revuwution i see!!! i was kinda a joke when i started. was 9, libraries had no internet, learnt BASIC from a 15 year old book,
@Trutherbotanyo2 I certainly am. All day bike rides with no phone, no fear of 'what if...'; not being constantly bugged by worried parent: 'Where are you? What time you coming back?' No addiction to sharing your every move with your 'followers' on social media. Just out and enjoying the day.
U meet someone. You 2 get close. It’s all great for a while. Then someone stops trying. Talk less. Awkward conv. The drifting. No communication whatsoever. Memories start 2 fade. Then that person u know becomes the person u KNEW. That’s how is usually goes, right? Sad isn’t it.
Guys I know how to fix the 3 no signal !You just turn/switch your phone off then switch it back on again! This worked for me and I tried it with my mum so I think it fight work for other people!
@LizSpeidel @AncientLitDude Times havd changed drastically and not for the better. When I was in my twenties (Lincoln was in office!), there was no internet, cell phones or SM:) if a guy wanted to get in your pants, he had to impress you. If they still do, they still do for me! 😉Stand your ground!

@ThreeUK So I have service back after going to/from airplane mode, but no WiFi calling. I've seen no official mention from @ThreeUK of issues remaining. Is that a known issue? I get no signal at home or work so WiFi calling is essential to me
No phone call. It’s okay we only like Chips Ahoy Chewy here anyways 🖕🏿
@Cricketnation Your rep said that I had no signal anywhere because a tower was down. A week later with no signal still I called your tech support. There were no towers down. Your rep lied. I don't trust your company at all.
@virginmedia That link seems to be broken. I entered my postcode and it says no known issues. But I have no internet and when I called Virgin the automated service says there is a fault and the lady said it will last till the 24th.

@duallyyyy They didn’t just hold them. They kept it on both sides with people having zero recourse. Closing accounts with no communication. The countless scams they turn a blind eye to. The fees are higher no longer competitive. They just haven’t innovated, deciding to milk the customers.
@WOWCare No internet yet again... What's going on with your service in Clearwater, FL?
How did @SadiqKhan ever get in the position he’s in? He is an odious arrogant little man with no communication skills and no ability. Astounding. https://t.co/GrMAKJJ2go

@RajendraTiwari7 @listenshahid Its obvious he will be unable to send, as there is no Internet in Kashmir. Wouldn't i breach a privacy cover by asking a password of Email?
@wojo4hitz @teganandsara Ik ik I think this no phone rule focuses more on the artist’s perception of the audience instead of the audience’s perception of the artist, like a mechanism to have a more intimate show. It kinda sucks for people like me who can’t go but I respect it though
@CityPowerJhb @PowerJhb @EskomFoundation @CityofJoburgZA Coming on 25 hours with no power in Highlands North. No communication received about when we can expect power back, no updates. Please advise!

@cholweshabukali What is happening in Zambia? No internet #GiveZambiaInternet 😂 https://t.co/geqREUNMzx
@ground_guru @Jimmy_shan78 @MyFootballCoach I think the problem is that some coaches dont understand that there is no communication or decision making in unopposed training, the exercise you do after it is key to adding in those components

what is Nomophobia?-the fear of being without your mobile phone
@yoggytree @C0MACR0W @spiderfrog93 @JanPritt @HPE You do realize that unless you're an actual hermit who grows their own food and has no internet, living in the country is actually more detrimental to the environment right?
I love going to @UofLFootball games however my only complaint is there is no phone service inside the stadium. @vincetyra can we get some boosters inside the stadium? #GoCards
@XavsFutbol It's about the strategy, Zidane has been playing with the same " Crossing " technique for ages now, it's clearly not working now and he is still stuck on it, the team had no communication just bad performance
@KantosKetchum I speak overpowered mother"Go to your room. No internet for a week."
@KarenCivil @Kehlani Producer @EricGgg recalled Mac freestyling the first half of “2009”: “He did the first whole half of the song in a pitch-black booth with no phone or anything. I don’t even know how he did it, and for it to be so meaningful.” https://t.co/ASpHmfEg3U
@jeremyarroyo @Yankees I remember my dad at the time, with no internet to fact-check, would mess with me by telling me the Yankees were going to trade him because he refused to get a haircut.This wasn't true... was it?As a sidebar... my mom was disgustingly in love with Dennis Eckersley.
You can be in the middle of civilization and you’d still have no signal with sprint. Worst provider I swear 🤦🏻‍♂️
@SkyHelpTeam Last week it went off because ‘no signal’ and the same thing has happened again tonight. A team of people couldn’t help when we rang, all they could do was ask us to pay more money on top of the £83 a month we currently pay,for something that is not working!
I’m really out here with no phone case just raw dogging it
@PlayStation No internet connection
@magneteach @sirDukeDevin Two Hundred and more years ago, with no e-mail, no TV and no internet, the Electoral College made a lot of sense, but today it makes no sense atall!
@Ryanair I understand we can't avoid the extremities of nature somethings. But the complete lack of organisation, no communication, and the fact 44 people were left stranded outside the airport waiting for a bus for 3 hours... Including 2 newborns. That's ridiculous and not OK!
Wow havent been on twitter no phone what did i miss
@sprintcare Over 2 hours and still no phone, what ...a...joke 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 https://t.co/BExAACKwsh
@ATT sure would be nice if you guys did what you say you would do. This in now twice I have schedule to have service turned on at my place and no one has shown up. No tech. No phone. No show and still NO SERVICE! Very frustrating.

@BestBuySupport My laptop is being sent to a service repair center which I found out by email and no phone call to update me on this before hand. I call the store only to be answered, transferred and hung up on, to then be asked for survey on my satisfaction. Are you serious?
@zuninja754 @PlayApex @EAHelp Wow. It is listed in literally every other place except for origin. I haven’t even wanted to play this game because of this. No communication and then finally I’m told just wait for it, eventually it might work out?! Not ok @EAHelp   Not ok.
@AmazonHelp @amazonIN @amazonhelp I rcvd emails that delivery was attempted when there was no phone call/message rcvd. This is falsified communication which can go against the company. You're open to cross validate with your internal comms systems

@IndiGo6E you have made a mockery out of your passenger. Because of your on ground crew. Me &amp; My colleague gets to not board the flight 6E-185 even after checking in 3hrs prior. due to lag of no communication between your on ground crew. #worstairlines #indigoairlines #airport

@sonicmeerkat Lol what are you a caveman? Get into the 21st Century grandad!Wait... my phone charge is dying... no phone, stay with me - I must continue Tweeting and get home bef
@NitrateVille I looked into this. No internet here but Comcast, cutting to just internet and adding a streaming tv service is roughly the same price as keeping the service I have, and the cloud DVR services on streaming are extremely limited
No internet connection here on campus so the Moroccan midget, Fatwhale, Monkeyass &amp; Military perps are on the run with their subs getting spots and creating hyperlinks in order to shoot EMF at me which they tried twice at this very moment 150 degrees hitting my right ankle... https://t.co/kbCdT8ZLPF

INJUSTICE: I've seen racism first hand &amp; today was my 2nd #DrivingWhileBlack for "running 🛑" &amp; "no signal" 🤷‍♀️ BS it was 2 black men that's why. They "smelled drugs". Cuffed them, had me sit in back of car. Found 0️⃣. Was I ok? Why? Because w/ Black Men? 🖕🐷Just sad and angry.
@TwinTemple Exactly! Unfortunately, the key words are intellect and knowledge. There was a time we had to seek this information out. There was no internet. Always breaking down and exploring. It pleases me to do it respectfully. Love you guys! Ave! 😈
@belindagrant80 Sorry Belinda, not today. But I'm here having my coffee now, and then I have to go and pack for a few days away with my parents. No internet access, poor mobile phone coverage, so probably no Twitter. But I'll be with you all in spirit.
SO IM PHONELESS
@KensingtonRoyal Please visit Indian Occupied Kashmir, the state has been sieged by Indian forces, it is a desperate humaitarian situation. 72 years of occupation and since 5th Aug the Kashmiris have no communication, no medical supplies and are being tortured.

@softhiin This person really needs help... and no internet connection..

@JoeUrquhartYEP Just a shame LUTV messed up and didn't work so we missed seeing this, all other celebrations, and lost importantly, the game. Still no communication from the club about it, loads of pissed off fans @andrearadri @LUFC , no word on refunds. @GrahamSmyth @LeedsNews

@MissAshes92 Glad to hear there is a gate. I haven't passed there in a while. This is a good site for a camera, compared to radar/laser gauges. Agree, underwater gauges are more susceptible to water and debris damage, and thus a false or no signal. You can tie that in to ATX.Floods.
@xSoulHunterDKx @DayZ @NakedByo For them to make it this far. Without the people who purchased the game, they wouldn't be where they are. It's a great game, incredible in my own opinion. But for about a week, it's been in a broken state, with no communication on the situation. Only a sales pitch. Not cool.

@snsachinnandu @oyorooms I had the same experience. Booked hotel with OYO at Haridwar and Gangotri for my parents. After reaching there, they came to know that those hotels have discontinued their relationship with OYO. There was no communication to us.
the only people more annoying than exols are 2nd generation stans bc in their time there was no internet so they were fighting physically and writing their drags down in notebooks and now we all suffering from 20th century jokes

@TheCriminalRose It had been months indeed, and unfortunately for them, things hadn't ended in the best of ways.Actually, they hadn't even ended.There was no closure, no communication.He didn't know where Neo had gone to,And he truly didn't want to know anyway. +

@Asameow17 @HeyRhett @kaye_el_bie @kissdeo02 Fans muna.. no phone for ML lol
@BSNLCorporate I guess bsnl is purposefully shutting down the internet in Karnataka, Bangalore, vijayanagar, if I call the customer service they ask me me call some other time, no use complaining in the exchange near me. They didn't resolve my prob. No internet from a week ..
@ladyrelodsalot @elgatogaming It’s not just in OBS though, it was saying no signal, now it’s just a black screen. In OBS and the elgato game capture app.

@AirtelNigeria despite full network signal on my phone, the recently purchased mifi has no internet access barely 2 wks after recharging. The same problem encountered soon after purchase of the mifi. Any solution to this? Many thanks.
@scottros @margaretomara What a great piece! Thanks for sharing. You put your finger on the tensions that most observers weren't thinking about for another 20 years. As for §230, we don't need to excuse misconduct to reverse the Stratton decision. The safe harbor is overbroad.https://t.co/dfw0tln3tK
@amy_tisi Strange that there was no signal eh?
I'm home now It was fun and all but it's good to be back I had no internet there too --"But hey I'm here,I'm safe

@Hermesparcels have waited in all day for a parcel that was to be delivered between 8am and 6pm and at 8pm nothing had arrived and there has been no communication. This is appalling customer service.
T-mobile boasts having 650 shops. But company is compromised by the lack of service on weekends! They offer a solution to problem - no signal , in 3 days. Big company shit and lack of competence of the Board. In communication services 8 hours is eternity and a complete disaster !
@LucySetonW Just got out of hot bath and have glass of wine. I’ll post some pics later. Had almost no signal most of the day, and got drenched and dazzled so pics not great. We will be doing this again, I’m sure. Xx
@LaurenGermanArg @JaneHil52691644 Hahahahaha !!!You're crazy!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻However, I'm at my parents, in the middle of the countryside, it's so lost that we have almost no internet signal, it is a torture to read your tweets, I think I will have to leave...

@BarbKaplitz @HeatherLinda11 @SparlingAngela Our experience is changes on pain medication and other stigmatized medications often no communication despite no reason.
@iGoBiTima @ATTHelp @ATT @GetSpectrum Probably. Our phone is connected to our internet. So no internet, no house phone. For months we would have times where we wouldn’t have service. It would start with outages for 30 minutes at a time up to the point it would be hours. Just tired of dealing with them.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Yeah. It’s in the basement with a secret door, and has no internet. https://t.co/GMYs8Q02Xh
@virginmedia is there an ongoing issue with broadband in the BD16 area? I’ve had numerous instances of no internet connection over the last week. Your app says that all’s fine with your service, your telephone message disagrees and says there’s an issue...any idea what’s going on
@karlmondon I remember that game well.  Washington was playing.  Back then, no internet, no big weather reports at your fingertips and no clue that wind was coming in the next day.
@Steph73_NL It's possible if it was trying to download an update to the walk that it was stuck waiting in an "I'm still downloading" state with no internet and not visible in my walks because of that.   If it's still not in My Walks, try re-running the app and doing "restore purchases".
@bt_uk I've gone 3 weeks with no internet and was really looking forward to having it again! It's like living in a cave!
@NickHunt7 i cant even do it. no internet😭😭😭😭
24hr no internet connection, enough

I remember when opening the browser icon on the phone was a big no no. Now if there is no internet for like a minute my phone is an idiot box https://t.co/rleoRQJ5io
Ladies, why do y’all send random pics out the blue after months of no communication.

Thought I was finna die wit no phone
@virginmedia Tried this but it doesn't do anything because there's no internet. Worse still just got back from a 13hr round trip to Liverpool traveling on a virgin train connected to virgin WiFi supplied by the train and couldn't connect with either 4g or WiFi

No phone or nothing like I just want peace
This generation has no communication skills... shit crazy 😂
@Steph73_NL Quite a lot of the routes have places with no internet at all so the app needs to work in no internet conditions.  All it needs is GPS (to be able to see the sky) during the walk.
@DakHarding We're in our rooms with no internet...
@Zuku_WeCare please fix account 871267 no Internet

@iwalkc I had my phone crash on me yesterday mid walk. I had no internet connection, so couldn’t reload my walk (no worries, I didn’t get lost). Is there a way to download my walks as a back up? Love your walks and the app!
@YeroTunder Yeah, when there's no internet around and I'm bored as hell 😆
Hate having no internet
And this is why it’ll never work 🤷🏾‍♀️ no communication
Woke up and only 2 notifications? Very disappointed in you people. Go to your rooms. No internet.
@BeSpleen @PamAinsley @kurteichenwald The difference from 1933 to 45 was, that these people were brainwashed by propaganda, there was no internet, no free press and hardly anyone travelled abroad. They believed the Nazi bullshit. Whoever believes the Trump lies and scaremongering is an idiot, a dangerous one, too !

@DrBeniRusani I don't know but we practice this. When we're going out together, no phone.. I mean, we still can take pictures or anything, but we use to talk, or staring at each other rather than playing with phone..
@MilaKunisNow Mila, return my call. Meaning actually pick the phone up and press on the key pad and dial my number so we can actually have conversation. We have been communicating for almost a year now. Still....no phone call! 1347-792-8575 ericaquino411@gmail.com. call meeeeee or email me.
There was no signal on the #PeoplesVoteMarch today. We made it to Parliament Sq due to some crafty shortcuts and heard the result of the #Letwin vote live. The roar from the crowd was awesome!

Stunningly rubbish customer service from @madebygoogle  @GoogleUK @google. No phone, no refund and 'compensation' offer worse than discount I used with original order.

@sweetmark2801 @nickjonas @priyankachopra Omg wow, it's so adorable to live in a militarized zone where there's no phone and internet access and ppl are routinely raped and murdered 😍
@VodafoneUK No phone call unfortunately. I'll PM you in case you can help.
Well, it seems another day of no Internet and no indication of how long this problem will last... @virginmedia, communication is important to customers in these times, I just wish I knew what was going on. Your website says no errors but the phone lines says engineers are on it.
The family's talking about christmas.. someone fucking save me from being stuck in the middle of the annual family Christmas arguments in someone else's house with no internet and no easy way to fuck off back home
@hjcampbell26 Except in HC there is often not another ''bakery'' depending on insurance and physical location. Also regardless businesses should have to give equal service to everyone. Otherwise we get all sorts of discrimination. Conservative? No internet for you. Trans? No HC for you etc.

Even now the order hasn't been delivered which was placed on 21:58. No communication from the delivery guy's end! And the outlet says that it is trying to reach him and inform asap!
No communication by the #njdevils. So many lost pucks and battles because they don’t talk and get caught in no mans land. Look so disorganized.
In my ten plus years of using @ATT I've never been so disappointed in their customer service. No internet for six days. No help. No solutions. Looking to @verizon or @GetSpectrum for proper service if either is interested in a new customer.
Day 2 of no internet Still fuckin bored
@ACTFibernet In the evening, I called your customer care where (AGAIN!!!) I was given a false assurance that it will be fixed in sometime but there’s still no internet. Your services are pathetic &amp; stop lying and giving false assurance
@GaylyDreadful No, because I'm stuck in the studio all weekend with no internet 😭😭😭
Y’all I literally woke up at 7:30 and literally walked to I could t walk anymore. Lately myself has been so off of my normal life and routine that I’ve been so nervous. Today walking 7 miles I think I found clarity. No phone, music, distractions. Just me and Mother Nature 💕

@ThePublius2020 I personally would like to hope he doesn't get really sick and have a stroke and have to poop in a bag that he has to wheel around with him and cannot talk and gets stuck in a nursing home with MSNBC 24 hours a day and no internet or way to tweet. That'd be very terrible for him.
@darling_sammy Instead of the phantom vibration in pants pocket sensation, a phantom fleshy hand caressing you from inside your pocket
It's not that I love Android, because I don't. It's just that I don't like iOS. I tried the Ubuntuphone, but as soon I booted the thing for the first time, I saw the complete failure of it. So I went back to Android. It's either that or no phone at all. https://t.co/8WHHgsqzni

Great weekend with no internet, it's not like I had a whole bunch of stuff to do anyway :' )
@Sidjohnsonnn It depends on when and where, but keep in mind there is zero support on for google fi issues. They will make you reboot your phone, buy new sim card before an "escalation" that takes 24-72hrs for response. That is a long time with no phone number.
Hi @TfL Not sure what’s happened to the underground WiFi, but my phone used to connect quickly and automatically. Now it rarely connects, and if it does, it takes a good couple of minutes. I can get on to the WiFi, but there’s no internet connection. Please help!

@virginmedia No, she couldn’t tell us when it started or when it was going to be fixed. Just that it was due to an upgrade in the area and to call back in two days if we had no internet. And said we could see the outage details on our account page. Which we can’t :(

Hey @cashapp ,How much money do you really save by not investing time and resources into @CashSupport ?No phone line? 48 hour email responses?Increase the transaction cost if you have to, this lack of support is a huge turnoff.

My favourite thing to do at the moment is go out with no phone like I used to, back in 1995, cos the phones were huge and cost $2 a minute to call people. Or if I do, make sure it's only at 10% power so I only use it in an emergency.
@Scala9111 That was two hours ago. No internet lol. We just landed! Thanks!❤⚘

@JioCare see this. We love Jio. Jio has revolutionized the telecom sectors, we should admit this. But still, I believe in Jio that's why I haven't ported my sim to other telecom.

Having no internet connection and to joke about it as a 1st world problem really bites you in the ass when you are at the receiving end of that joke. My entitled-self is internally screaming, no doubt.
If you are using paraffin for heating it is more likely that you have no internet access
@OpenreachHelp Hi Openreach attended my home on Wednesday to connect phonline/internet, was unable to connect due to external fault. An Openreach engineer was booked via EE for yesterday to connect my internet/phone line in N22 8DN. Today, I STILL have no internet/phonline.

@ThePublius2020 Trump doesn't need any books. He gets a television with two stations: Fox and RT. The internet with access to only Twitter. We want to be able to read about his brilliant thoughts.  No phone. A nine hole golf course with boulders strewn about and day old fast food and Moxie.

@IndiGo6E you have made a mockery out of your passenger. Because of your on ground crew. Me &amp; My colleague gets to not board the flight 6E-185 even after checking in 3hrs prior. due to lag of no communication between your on ground crew. #worstairlines #indigoairlines #airport
@sektor it gives us signal, if theres no cable then we can’t watch bc no signal KEKW

Sitting in a parking lot waiting to see hot air balloons and I have little to no signal...
@iWilliiam @BenGeskin @91mobiles No phone yet has a smaller hole than the Note 10. And S11 will be even smaller.
Third grade level! For a career politician, Nancy has "NO" communication skills in a room full of men &amp; "REAL" agenda.  Pelosi has a history of walking out of important meetings when she isn't happy...FAILED LEADERSHIP!Sh*t on S.F. sidewalks speaks volumes for Pelosi policy. https://t.co/IpBkhJRgZc
@AMDGaming i assume theres no internet so ill settle for a singleplayer game like wolfenstein

@jaffathecake @dassurma I'm using Share Target (v2) in an app that is enabled for offline. Launching the app from the home screen fully works in airplane mode, but sharing to it fails due to no internet. Is this really broken or am I doing it wrong? https://t.co/5tQ3auI0u1

@ChoeNut This person pretended to care when I was at my lowest &amp; once I got boring, she said it wasn't fun anymore &amp; she ended  the friendship. Via text, no phone call or anything. This was a life lesson to help me recognize future frauds.
@sonicmeerkat Lol what are you a caveman? Get into the 21st Century grandad!Wait... my phone charge is dying... no phone, stay with me - I must continue Tweeting and get home bef
@NitrateVille I looked into this. No internet here but Comcast, cutting to just internet and adding a streaming tv service is roughly the same price as keeping the service I have, and the cloud DVR services on streaming are extremely limited
No internet connection here on campus so the Moroccan midget, Fatwhale, Monkeyass &amp; Military perps are on the run with their subs getting spots and creating hyperlinks in order to shoot EMF at me which they tried twice at this very moment 150 degrees hitting my right ankle... https://t.co/kbCdT8ZLPF
@joswinson There was no signal to send the email in the ditch. Carrier pigeon only. It'll arrive in the EU in the next few weeks.

INJUSTICE: I've seen racism first hand &amp; today was my 2nd #DrivingWhileBlack for "running 🛑" &amp; "no signal" 🤷‍♀️ BS it was 2 black men that's why. They "smelled drugs". Cuffed them, had me sit in back of car. Found 0️⃣. Was I ok? Why? Because w/ Black Men? 🖕🐷Just sad and angry.
@TwinTemple Exactly! Unfortunately, the key words are intellect and knowledge. There was a time we had to seek this information out. There was no internet. Always breaking down and exploring. It pleases me to do it respectfully. Love you guys! Ave! 😈
@belindagrant80 Sorry Belinda, not today. But I'm here having my coffee now, and then I have to go and pack for a few days away with my parents. No internet access, poor mobile phone coverage, so probably no Twitter. But I'll be with you all in spirit.
SO IM PHONELESS
@KensingtonRoyal Please visit Indian Occupied Kashmir, the state has been sieged by Indian forces, it is a desperate humaitarian situation. 72 years of occupation and since 5th Aug the Kashmiris have no communication, no medical supplies and are being tortured.
@ThreeUK I want to leave your network. No signal or just shitty in general...at times when I most needed it and your customer service is even worse!!!!!!!!
@josayye1 @gvbbylvls @Kkaylahernandex Having a good time no phone in sight, photographic memory more liek
@BrynLaw @ben_parker19 @LUFC @andrearadri @leedsunitedtv @JayMooney86 What's happening about everyone who paid for LUTV today but got no stream and no communication from the club? Nothing has been mentioned.

@VicVanquish Bruh you got a phone. Back in my day rehab meant no phone 😭
@softhiin This person really needs help... and no internet connection..
I woke up this morning in someone else’s shirt, my rings on the wrong finger, hair a mess and NO PHONE. I’m thinking “i lost my phone it’s probably in Mexico already” haha. I just wanna talk to the person who let me get drunk.. 🥴
@JoeUrquhartYEP Just a shame LUTV messed up and didn't work so we missed seeing this, all other celebrations, and lost importantly, the game. Still no communication from the club about it, loads of pissed off fans @andrearadri @LUFC , no word on refunds. @GrahamSmyth @LeedsNews
Did this last night at dinner after teaching. Only seat left at lovely bay-beside restaurant, Saltwater Fish, was corner barstool. Just sat...calmed out. No book, no writing, no phone.

@Flow no internet @cooperage for a week now
So uh about the video. My dad yeeted my phone and said no phone while on the hike so I didnt record anything.... Sorry gamers maybe next time smh
@emileighsrose Bands did a lot of stupid shit in the day to get noticed. There was no internet to beat them down for it. It was all about selling records, not downloads.

@Reuters I like this lady.   She is on the ball.  Not trying to bullshit the American people.  Freedom first.  No  communication with Area 51 .   Wacko’s

Aur mari ex ka connection Ptcl ke taraa ta connect taa but no internet  (no feelings for me) https://t.co/KAl2BMGVIf
@MissAshes92 Glad to hear there is a gate. I haven't passed there in a while. This is a good site for a camera, compared to radar/laser gauges. Agree, underwater gauges are more susceptible to water and debris damage, and thus a false or no signal. You can tie that in to ATX.Floods.
@xSoulHunterDKx @DayZ @NakedByo For them to make it this far. Without the people who purchased the game, they wouldn't be where they are. It's a great game, incredible in my own opinion. But for about a week, it's been in a broken state, with no communication on the situation. Only a sales pitch. Not cool.
@annakhachiyan Somewhere with no internet connection
I can't watch any streams!!😦 I literally have only 2gb of data left... Having no internet is hard!! I have to act like a human! https://t.co/lQ7vOK9MyG

Just thought up of a nice idea for a #Kenshi Halloween mod as part of the community discord event! Will work on it while my desktop has no Internet connection :)
@Asmali77 Kenyans jameni,question/answer and no communication
@snsachinnandu @oyorooms I had the same experience. Booked hotel with OYO at Haridwar and Gangotri for my parents. After reaching there, they came to know that those hotels have discontinued their relationship with OYO. There was no communication to us.
the only people more annoying than exols are 2nd generation stans bc in their time there was no internet so they were fighting physically and writing their drags down in notebooks and now we all suffering from 20th century jokes
chris you said you can be my boyfriend, well: BE MY BF AND LET ME SLEEP AT YOURS NEXT SATURDAY CAUSE MY BROTHER JUST KICKED ME OUT AND I HAVE TO GO TO MY GRANDPARENTS with no internet and other problematic stuff
@mrcollins_o No battery = no phone
@TheCriminalRose It had been months indeed, and unfortunately for them, things hadn't ended in the best of ways.Actually, they hadn't even ended.There was no closure, no communication.He didn't know where Neo had gone to,And he truly didn't want to know anyway. +
I'm working in a pop culture event and no signal of a Madeline/Badeline cosplay, i'm so disappointed
@Shizzle1124 @pulte Yeah i can see that...i honestly havent seen anyone who has won the money...i keep seeing these but never see videos of the winners..no phone calls SS or anything..so im leary of these
Was that a bout of nomophobia, @evolvingTLS? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a great idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #usecase
I went into a library today and saw a teenage boy reading a book on a sofa with some biscuits next to him. No phone. No headphones. Nothing but the book and his snacks. So pure ❤️

@Airtel_Presence Dear #BhartiAirtel the continues efforts to keep ur consumer n trouble doing successfully great."30 min of NO NETWORK 12.07 am to 12.37 am",Think of it bcoz I missed my booked cab due to no communication, and wasting my time at midnight in wait of morning for general transport
@TanTran__ @ATT dude..... i woke up devastated because i had no internet
How the fuck did I agree to this phoneless speakeasy bullshit DURING SATURDAY FOOTBALL?!?!?!?!?
@Asameow17 @HeyRhett @kaye_el_bie @kissdeo02 Fans muna.. no phone for ML lol
@BSNLCorporate I guess bsnl is purposefully shutting down the internet in Karnataka, Bangalore, vijayanagar, if I call the customer service they ask me me call some other time, no use complaining in the exchange near me. They didn't resolve my prob. No internet from a week ..
@ladyrelodsalot @elgatogaming It’s not just in OBS though, it was saying no signal, now it’s just a black screen. In OBS and the elgato game capture app.

@AirtelNigeria despite full network signal on my phone, the recently purchased mifi has no internet access barely 2 wks after recharging. The same problem encountered soon after purchase of the mifi. Any solution to this? Many thanks.
@scottros @margaretomara What a great piece! Thanks for sharing. You put your finger on the tensions that most observers weren't thinking about for another 20 years. As for §230, we don't need to excuse misconduct to reverse the Stratton decision. The safe harbor is overbroad.https://t.co/dfw0tln3tK
@amy_tisi Strange that there was no signal eh?
I'm home now It was fun and all but it's good to be back I had no internet there too --"But hey I'm here,I'm safe
Not no texting to make sure i was straight, no phone calls, i mean physically 🖤💯 that’s my dawg 4L
@Hermesparcels have waited in all day for a parcel that was to be delivered between 8am and 6pm and at 8pm nothing had arrived and there has been no communication. This is appalling customer service.
T-mobile boasts having 650 shops. But company is compromised by the lack of service on weekends! They offer a solution to problem - no signal , in 3 days. Big company shit and lack of competence of the Board. In communication services 8 hours is eternity and a complete disaster !
@LucySetonW Just got out of hot bath and have glass of wine. I’ll post some pics later. Had almost no signal most of the day, and got drenched and dazzled so pics not great. We will be doing this again, I’m sure. Xx
@LaurenGermanArg @JaneHil52691644 Hahahahaha !!!You're crazy!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻However, I'm at my parents, in the middle of the countryside, it's so lost that we have almost no internet signal, it is a torture to read your tweets, I think I will have to leave...

@BarbKaplitz @HeatherLinda11 @SparlingAngela Our experience is changes on pain medication and other stigmatized medications often no communication despite no reason.
@iGoBiTima @ATTHelp @ATT @GetSpectrum Probably. Our phone is connected to our internet. So no internet, no house phone. For months we would have times where we wouldn’t have service. It would start with outages for 30 minutes at a time up to the point it would be hours. Just tired of dealing with them.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Yeah. It’s in the basement with a secret door, and has no internet. https://t.co/GMYs8Q02Xh
@virginmedia is there an ongoing issue with broadband in the BD16 area? I’ve had numerous instances of no internet connection over the last week. Your app says that all’s fine with your service, your telephone message disagrees and says there’s an issue...any idea what’s going on
@karlmondon I remember that game well.  Washington was playing.  Back then, no internet, no big weather reports at your fingertips and no clue that wind was coming in the next day.
@Steph73_NL It's possible if it was trying to download an update to the walk that it was stuck waiting in an "I'm still downloading" state with no internet and not visible in my walks because of that.   If it's still not in My Walks, try re-running the app and doing "restore purchases".
@bt_uk I've gone 3 weeks with no internet and was really looking forward to having it again! It's like living in a cave!
@NickHunt7 i cant even do it. no internet😭😭😭😭
24hr no internet connection, enough
No internet till atleast Tuesday... Thanks @tmobile_webcare
It’s funny I saw her at the (kinda) beginning (Lungs era REPRESENT) and at the latest and to see her growth vocals and performance wise was so amazing to witness (sadly I don’t have any vids from the first concert cause I had no phone). okay I’m done rambling
I remember when opening the browser icon on the phone was a big no no. Now if there is no internet for like a minute my phone is an idiot box https://t.co/rleoRQJ5io
Ladies, why do y’all send random pics out the blue after months of no communication.

Thought I was finna die wit no phone
@virginmedia Tried this but it doesn't do anything because there's no internet. Worse still just got back from a 13hr round trip to Liverpool traveling on a virgin train connected to virgin WiFi supplied by the train and couldn't connect with either 4g or WiFi
@IyIaah Thought you had no internet
can we go to cafe and just drink coffee, no phone. you and me. talk eye to eye

Immediately you say "I Love you," .....she becomes cashless, phoneless, dataless, homeless, fatherless. All kinds of less!🤣🤣🤣
No phone or nothing like I just want peace
This generation has no communication skills... shit crazy 😂
@Steph73_NL Quite a lot of the routes have places with no internet at all so the app needs to work in no internet conditions.  All it needs is GPS (to be able to see the sky) during the walk.
@DakHarding We're in our rooms with no internet...
@Zuku_WeCare please fix account 871267 no Internet
@AnisTabet23 Only in Lebanon would the people be so disrespected to the point where after DAYS of protests, there’s no communication whatsoever from/about the president
@iwalkc I had my phone crash on me yesterday mid walk. I had no internet connection, so couldn’t reload my walk (no worries, I didn’t get lost). Is there a way to download my walks as a back up? Love your walks and the app!
@YeroTunder Yeah, when there's no internet around and I'm bored as hell 😆
Hate having no internet
And this is why it’ll never work 🤷🏾‍♀️ no communication
Woke up and only 2 notifications? Very disappointed in you people. Go to your rooms. No internet.
@BeSpleen @PamAinsley @kurteichenwald The difference from 1933 to 45 was, that these people were brainwashed by propaganda, there was no internet, no free press and hardly anyone travelled abroad. They believed the Nazi bullshit. Whoever believes the Trump lies and scaremongering is an idiot, a dangerous one, too !

@DrBeniRusani I don't know but we practice this. When we're going out together, no phone.. I mean, we still can take pictures or anything, but we use to talk, or staring at each other rather than playing with phone..
@MilaKunisNow Mila, return my call. Meaning actually pick the phone up and press on the key pad and dial my number so we can actually have conversation. We have been communicating for almost a year now. Still....no phone call! 1347-792-8575 ericaquino411@gmail.com. call meeeeee or email me.
There was no signal on the #PeoplesVoteMarch today. We made it to Parliament Sq due to some crafty shortcuts and heard the result of the #Letwin vote live. The roar from the crowd was awesome!

Stunningly rubbish customer service from @madebygoogle  @GoogleUK @google. No phone, no refund and 'compensation' offer worse than discount I used with original order.

@cherrylaneGC Hi, I booked 4 tickets for the Halloween event at Podington on evening of 30th October. I’ve seen on Facebook that this even was removed. Is it no longer taking place? I’ve had no communication regarding this and certainly no refund. Can you please advise??? Thanks
@sweetmark2801 @nickjonas @priyankachopra Omg wow, it's so adorable to live in a militarized zone where there's no phone and internet access and ppl are routinely raped and murdered 😍
@VodafoneUK No phone call unfortunately. I'll PM you in case you can help.
Well, it seems another day of no Internet and no indication of how long this problem will last... @virginmedia, communication is important to customers in these times, I just wish I knew what was going on. Your website says no errors but the phone lines says engineers are on it.
The family's talking about christmas.. someone fucking save me from being stuck in the middle of the annual family Christmas arguments in someone else's house with no internet and no easy way to fuck off back home
@hjcampbell26 Except in HC there is often not another ''bakery'' depending on insurance and physical location. Also regardless businesses should have to give equal service to everyone. Otherwise we get all sorts of discrimination. Conservative? No internet for you. Trans? No HC for you etc.

No communication by the #njdevils. So many lost pucks and battles because they don’t talk and get caught in no mans land. Look so disorganized.
In my ten plus years of using @ATT I've never been so disappointed in their customer service. No internet for six days. No help. No solutions. Looking to @verizon or @GetSpectrum for proper service if either is interested in a new customer.
Day 2 of no internet Still fuckin bored
@ACTFibernet In the evening, I called your customer care where (AGAIN!!!) I was given a false assurance that it will be fixed in sometime but there’s still no internet. Your services are pathetic &amp; stop lying and giving false assurance
@GaylyDreadful No, because I'm stuck in the studio all weekend with no internet 😭😭😭
Y’all I literally woke up at 7:30 and literally walked to I could t walk anymore. Lately myself has been so off of my normal life and routine that I’ve been so nervous. Today walking 7 miles I think I found clarity. No phone, music, distractions. Just me and Mother Nature 💕

@darling_sammy Instead of the phantom vibration in pants pocket sensation, a phantom fleshy hand caressing you from inside your pocket
It's not that I love Android, because I don't. It's just that I don't like iOS. I tried the Ubuntuphone, but as soon I booted the thing for the first time, I saw the complete failure of it. So I went back to Android. It's either that or no phone at all. https://t.co/8WHHgsqzni

@Sidjohnsonnn It depends on when and where, but keep in mind there is zero support on for google fi issues. They will make you reboot your phone, buy new sim card before an "escalation" that takes 24-72hrs for response. That is a long time with no phone number.
Hi @TfL Not sure what’s happened to the underground WiFi, but my phone used to connect quickly and automatically. Now it rarely connects, and if it does, it takes a good couple of minutes. I can get on to the WiFi, but there’s no internet connection. Please help!

@Stillberto One of the most frustrating things about the way VAR is currently used is that there is no communication of the reasoning behind decisions. I would love to hear the conversation between the officials that resulted in that penalty not being given.

I saw a guy at Starbucks today.No tablet.No laptop.No phone. No lights. No motor cars.Not a single luxury. He just sat there.Drinking coconut water.Like a Robinson Crusoe, as primitive as can be.
4/... All this really helped..... And then I decided I needed a longer term vision. A plan... ... ... So I went to the Job Centre (in Rawtenstall) and I began looking through the careers book (a huge book). We had no internet then, remember!? Anyway, I stumbled across...

@DaveVescio @BrandonJRouth @StephenAmell  That reminds me of this: “No phone, no lights, no motor carnot a single luxurylike Robinson Crusoe,it's primitive as can be.” 🤣🤣🤣
My favourite thing to do at the moment is go out with no phone like I used to, back in 1995, cos the phones were huge and cost $2 a minute to call people. Or if I do, make sure it's only at 10% power so I only use it in an emergency.
@Scala9111 That was two hours ago. No internet lol. We just landed! Thanks!❤⚘

@ThePublius2020 Trump doesn't need any books. He gets a television with two stations: Fox and RT. The internet with access to only Twitter. We want to be able to read about his brilliant thoughts.  No phone. A nine hole golf course with boulders strewn about and day old fast food and Moxie.

@plusnethelp no internet again today. Called your helpline &amp; have an engineer coming out (for the third time) to fix it on Monday. I’m not confident. Don’t use plusnet for your ISP lads. Turns out they *do* let you down. Constantly.
@selfstyledsiren Growing up in the 70s, Judge Crater was a pretty common reference, but there was no internet and I never knew what the hell it meant.

I love @ThreeUK, but the recent outside has been handled terribly. No communication for something like 6 hours of the outage. Today we get an email saying "Sorry, if you want to know your options call us". Just say sorry and refund everyone 1 day line usage. https://t.co/qxGB33hsGl

No chat  x no communication. 👍
@Chico3DSquirrel I am absolutely devastated.  I have had to say goodbye to my iPhone   That is why I did not come back on last night.  Something had gone wrong in the connection of the phone for charging. Problem with iphones they cost so mu;ch to get mended.  I had no phone
@BanKsEsports most importantly there was no internet to spoil the whole thing
@cbschicago I really wish you would address the issue on why #CBS #CBS2Chicago is the hardest channel in Chicago to pick up with an antenna. I had finally found a antenna position to get #CBS then we had to rescan all channels. Now the channel name shows up but still no signal.

@KeithMillsD7 @Donnachain22 there is a conscious, deliberate &amp; sinister policy to sneak in hundreds of so-called 'asylum seekers' under dead of night into small villages around Ireland! No consultation, no communication, no choice!
The recent mess at @ThreeUK finally pushed me to move to a different carrier. Months of no internet in town centerMonths of adult filter blocking things even though it's offDozens of times on the phone with supportLasw few days were even worse. Bye @ThreeUK Hello @PlusNet
@SKYserves we have no internet connection today. Please check

@sextoyspolitics I just went upstairs to watch it, it got like 30 seconds in and now it's stuck on an infinite load. Sometimes the internet here just doesn't work right. It's totally rediculous but it's this or no internet.

@SkyUK Months with intermittent broadband connection. 4 engineers. Hours and hours of phone calls. 22 different people telling me it will be fixed. And guess what. I wake up this morning and still no internet. Sky you are a joke. Equipment is going in the bin.

Hopeless customer service @asianetcabletv after upgrading to your digital TV I am suffering from bad picture quality, no signal issues everyday. Why am I paying you anything...last 3 days no cable even after making 10 to 30 calls to your customer service.
@ThreeUK so got up this morning and had WiFi calling in my house - took phone with me outside and came back to ‘no service’. Phone is useless without it as no signal in our village - please get it sorted!  Done all usual fixes ....

@MJairosi No signal is needed to be given to start the rebellion. Spontaneous reactions from people all over Zimbabwe will do. If you organise a date and place the junta will counter and put security or even ban. That's the reason why at any hint of protest police are thrown in the roads
@bt_uk Hi Paula, the pic shows what I should be getting (100m download and 10m upload minimum) My internet keeps dropping with no internet for hours at a time. Last night I had no internet for 6 hours.

@ThreeUK Please help me out here, my phone still has no signal despite turning it off and on countless times. I've even traveled from the I.O.W to Surrey with still no sign of any signal. To add to this, my three phone number was meant to be transferred from my old three sim
@DXdelivery for 3 days I’ve had my delivery booked in and promised within certain time and each has failed no communication. I have to collect from you today as I’ve stressed multiple times I need it this weekend. Shocking service!

@nobucchika THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ME AND KEN ARE LEFT W NO INTERNET DURING THE DAY WE BECOME ACTUAL ANIMALS
@selfawaresoup @la_mafaldita Ever travelled from Munic into Austria? By train (DB...😭)? There is virually NO internet reception before crossing the Austrian border, except when finally reaching some town. But, as soon as in Austria, zack, 4G (to be fair, nothing in the tunnels on the Austrian side).
@DoT_India It's possible to Get UPC CODE for my old AIRCEL Number But unfortunately there is no signal is displaying but I need that number

@shaunamkinney I used an online retailer from that area, and it took a week for my order to be dispatched. Almost no communication from them.Never again. shaking my fist ;-)
@iamanandd @naukarshah You are diverting the issue by taking it to a personal plain. Even if my mobile phone remains blocked, I shall not be silenced. Read the history of our freedom struggle? There was no phone, yet people protested. You people are indirectly helping two-nation theorists.

Wow @VodafoneGhana my broadband stopped working last night (second time this week)  and I was forced to sleep. I wake up and still no internet? Please give me back my internet, I paid for It.
@VOXI_UK thanks for screwing up my order! Despite my following instructions, you have transferred my old number to a sim that I don’t have 😡🤷‍♀️ and now refuse to transfer it to the Actual Sim that You Sent Me. WTF?? I am now meant to have no phone service for 3 days??

@Dorns84 Just staring at the side of your bonce. No communication 😂😂😂 final whistle goes “right, how is everyone?”
@IndiaPostOffice Went to post office yesterday. But as has been the case, no internet banking for my existing account. Thrice it has happened now, and twice after you have had given clear Instructions.
@colettebrowne People in communities have concerns, some of them legitimate, some of them based on ignorance, some of them abhorrently racist. Common theme seems to be a vacuum of planning and no communication plans or integration investment/plans from government. This needs to improve
@SafaricomPLC  why no internet access?

@DevilishDanni @instagram Well it's early days I suppose but no sign of anything just yet, wouldn't surprise me if no communication. I've emailed them, contacted them on here and Instagram itself. Time will tell
No electricity, no water, no internet  the whole day yesterday.  It gave me an opportunity to spend time with my family, they are actually very good and nice  people 🤩🤩#Zambia#LoadShedding
Succeed with no instagram for 2 weeks and now i was thinking to get this nokia phone so that i’m away from this socmed/smartphone thingy. But, sometime i was thinking its better to have no phone at all. #JustSaying https://t.co/yOmPNHL21M
Ugh. I have 3 days left to make this money or no internet. I'm just realizing this NOW of all times. Pray for me, I think sleep no longer counts as an option if I want to keep my internet on 😭😭😭 #help
Fuck me no signal for days actually about 5 minutes before saying oh you want it THATs the way forward.
@Bluestockingmum @woofit79 @BBCNews They always do. It's just normally we're all on the march with no signal.
@goibibo Your customer care agent raised a ticket and asked me to respond to the same email with files from my end (which I did). It has been two days now and there has been no communication after the initial phone conversation. How do I proceed?
@ACTFibernet Very bad service.  More than 30 hours no internet in home. Ticket No:SR10331469088262  . Almost 1 or 2 days in every week, I am facing internet failures. If this is the situation, I have to disconnect your services.
Not having no phone a different kinda ass

@VodafoneUK 11 days in total and next to nothing has been done. I get promised phone calls when things are done, but no phone call. I have to chase. Yet still nothing has been done. Poor customer service and I’ve tried complaining but heard nothing back!! Please sort this ASAP!!

I'm very disappointed by the service of @officiald2h ... Always showing no signal or other issues but home channel is showing... Whenever I call to customer care they give silly reasons

@nuency25 @ClimateAudit @JupiterWalls @ombudsman4truth @sunmaster14 @ProfMJCleveland @HansMahncke There is no Presidential route for surveillance on US Persons, it’s a myth. That is for authorizing surveillance on enemy facilities that have no communication with Americans, so like a Russian Navy base.
Same is happening with me account no#1145374633, @HathwayBrdband  your network sucks..for last 10 day there is network issue. Either there is no internet for hours or when it comes it gets disconnected very soon..using @JioCare or @Airtel_Presence  hotspot for internet. https://t.co/ly4q5pZxHH
@trey_sheppard @shadxjose Bruh . Smh no phone or nothing
having no phone is really ass
@WizardWhistle No phone is more durable than another tbh. Put on a tempered glass, use a good case, and dont bring it near water ever. Phone batteries will always degrade with time/use but the Note 10 battery is the best out of these choices.
@pammy3006 agreed. Just a term created.  The old days was no phone call returned.
Let me just hop on lea- oh yeah, no internet Let me play smash onli- haha...Well I’ll just watch some ani- fuck

In 1999, NASA lost communication with the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter. A contractor had written a program for the orbiter using imperial units, as is standard in the U.S., but NASA’s software used the metric system. https://t.co/CiIgbjHHZM our @charles_duan in @Slate
@Zlatan_Ibile Na so we were suppose to vote for you.  But no phone to vote it. P
@VZWSupport Both. Some places outdoors we get no signal. Same with indoors. Dropped calls, no service, etc. If we move to certain areas in the house, we get at most three bars. It’s been going on since we have had smartphones-years.
@OptimumHelp I AM REPAIRED! KUDOS TO EMILE! HE WAS HERE ALL AFTERNOON! How do I get a credit for all the time that my service has been going in and out? Almost 2 months! One day I had no service, the next day I had tv but no phone or internet, the next it was vice versa! Two long months!
I HAVE NO SIGNAL HERE I MISS EVERYONE AND BTS
@TabithaKhaye No phone, no fb, no communication, except twitter really, so often I just venture out hoping to run into somebody, but alas, either they also avoiding the slander, drama, etc, or I just don't matter that much I guess, except to be pestered, and annoyed.. *Le Sigh* Fml, now I am
@dana_howl Love the idea... but i would like to see it executed using a $10 budget and no internet access.$50 per month is what most of us already are doing (or would like to be doing)
No internet, no WiFi. 💩💩💩Can’t even tag Northwestern to voice my displeasure...
She literally is happy im phoneless
What is the thought process whereby a person decides to text another person they barely know after 4 yrs of no communication? Do ppl just scroll through their contacts and randomly text ppl? I'm curious abt this but not curious enough to respond to the random that just texted me https://t.co/69Q2B3AJH0
@pulte @PulteDaily I might be without power and all contact if pg&amp;e moves their shutoff line even half a mile, no phone Wi-Fi nothing. A cheap hotel for the weekend would be a blessing
@shivers_raymond @matthewfleming @Da3LeggedFreak @TheDivisionGame Go into a discovery raid match make tell me how that goes.

A week with no internet connection and no response from your team except to give a ticket. Are you lacking in manpower but still getting new clients yet fail to service those who already have accounts with you? https://t.co/iJxlb05qr7
@sheryljames She was arrested last Saturday. No phone call till yesterday. I have a feeling they helped her detox, although I haven't asked. She  always knows that I will talk to her no matter what. I won't pay her bail again, tough lesson learned, for me.
@TerrapinRow What’s a better way to study than with no internet?

#donedelete no phone.
@purrcarriemeow @LoomesGill @sarasiobhan @POhWERadvocacy @CitizensAdvice Its easy money ... Vulnerable adults can't make to the walkin's and there's no phone number and no staff to help.

BasementCon is off to a rousing start.We have no internet and no WiFi, not any TV, in the location. We have three DVDs provided to us by the lodge owners. They are Master and Commander, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and three episodes of season 2 of Duck Hunters.
@aurajinallamour Exactly!!!! I always told myself I would never treat my kids how my mom did us . There distant love and no communication in this house . It's so crazy but I've grown out of having feelings towards that it literally doesn't effect me anymore . Sometimes you have to grow up before

#DanfoNigeria’s symbol of anyhowness.The buses have no signal lights or mirrors. They always look beat-up, they deface our roads. Everyday, someone is bashed by a danfo. The drivers are not licensed, you can’t do anything to them. But everyone is just causally ignoring. https://t.co/P1xNr8IHjt

@AmazonHelp Fire stick is plugged into TV and power power source (wall). TV set to hdmi, no signal. Fire stick won't turn on. Power cord was tested and is fine. Hdmi adapter was tested and is fine. TV hdmi port was tested and is fine.Seems the issue is the stick itself.

@Tesla ...with repeated followups till 10/23, i was told there was no loaner available and on 10/24 all followups stopped from SC. No phone calls were returned to me either. Is this how you guys treat customers who spend a $100 Grand on a car, you should be shameful.!
@_heylauren Worst part is no communication from the devs at all at least address to the community you know of/ are working on the issues or if they feel like it is something that they don’t want to take out the game at least tell us so we all don’t have to tweet out the same issues :(
highly considering going phoneless 2020
@OoredooMaldives Hello @OoredooMaldives, it's no Internet. Again.

@IsayIsayIsay1 @ThreeUKSupport And in the mean time I’m posting for unlimited data, getting no internet access, having to use free wifi just to google for updates because you don’t think it’s important to either keep the network running or keep customers informed
@JeffreeStar I have like no internet connection so I can’t😭😭

@hage_mo Hi, you messed up our Lufa Farms delivery, and there’s no phone number to get hold of the delivery guy to fix it. Disgraceful service, and no way to rectify. We expect a full cash refund.
I literally have no phone for the next few days feck
@PurolatorHelp No card...no phone call...please examine how I'm suppose to know I have a package in!? Most times I don't even know which courier a company is shipping to us with. I have to run all over town trying to find my packages. I will insist on companies not using Purolator to avoid this
Week two with no phone and it’s been a struggle
@PurolatorHelp There was no card. So no card, no phone call. Am I suppose to be a mind reader?? 2 WEEKS IT WAS THERE. So I finally go get it and with my back out, carry the 70 lb. package up the stairs.  If this was the first time this happened that would be one thing but it has happened before
It seems like every month that I have to deal with @GetSpectrum outages or some kind of interruption due to crap equipment. No internet or cable for a second day. https://t.co/Lp8s1gQFhT
@PurolatorHelp I was told there was no phone call by your depot because the phone number wasn't in the label. I contacted the company I bought the item from and they say they sent it and you didnt put it on
@Scottcrates @ResisterSis20 Luxury prison with no internet, only classic books. They serve only RAW vegan food. Goat Yoga class is mandatory, as is the strict no makeup or hair products policy. Hey. Hell is what hurts the most. This is his Hell. https://t.co/N2vcHVZx0T
@PurolatorHelp Shipping by courier is to get items fast. I have been waiting and calling trying to find my package to find out it has been sitting FOR 2 WEEKS at the depot. No card at my office (and it was open the day you claim you attempted delivery) and no phone call...
@hsieh_zachary Dang I actually need it I have no phone just a I pad

@VZWSupport I have no internet service and can only get one or two bars. I was bumped up to another rep who assured me that verizon wasn't throttling me. He had me swap out my Sim Card, but that didn't aolve the problem. This has been an escalating issue for about a year.
@paul_winginit It's great no phone signal you can relax. Nothing reason why i like not having WiFi on flights not forced to check my emails

When you crack your phone screen and @USCellular says they will overnight you a new phone: 😊When its been 5 days and no phone so you call back and get told "oh, they didn't tell you they were backordered? Our bad. We don't know when you will get one": 😠 Thanks USCellular 🙄

Nothing makes me feel old like hearing my husband explain to my daughter there was no internet, smart phones or Netflix when we were kids.
Over 50+ days no internet and today was our drop team appointment and they no showed. Again. For the third time. How is this an escalation @TELUS @TELUSsupport ? I think you’re lying to us. How does your drop team no show 3 appointments in a row and over 50 days straight?
I can’t with ESOL students man😭 one goes to his friend “Thor fono signal ar ni beh amar tath ‘no signal’ aya boythakseh” 😩😂😂😂

@SonicTelecoms Hi Sonic, less than 48 hours into a new Contract with no signal. I want out now. Please come and collect your Installation materials.
@sebas05000 @ari_bloch @JohnLegere @NevilleRay Typically poor quality SINR and RSRQ I suspect are the issues in this area.  Looks like T-Mobile must be actually working on it today - no signal from that site.. but typically getting 3/5 'bars' from a site up on the hill.  Overlay in this area may be the key.
glad i don’t fw no internet ass nigga, y’all be embarrassing yourselves on this app

This ain’t no phone plan when I put my brothers on
@AITA_reddit YTA, she has literally no idea why you’re acting like this due to no communication of past feelings of any sort. I’ve had a few guy pals I was close with from hs I tried to reconnect w/ that were rude n cold to me, most likely cuz Im married now. Friendship ain’t enough for some
@Ask_Spectrum so 5 days no phone or internet in Charlotte NC for me and my neighbor's. Is there a reason for this?

@bt_uk what an insult no internet till Tuesday the engineer didn't even bother to show up after spending the whole afternoon in the house. My son has disability and needs the internet to keep occupied. Again BT said they are going to call but nothing again

Dear #RealEstate industry,You really need to start putting the ISP's available and the internet speed packages available where a house is located. It's just as, if not more important, than the school systems. I wouldn't move to a house that has slow/no internet.
@SunTrust Hey Suntrust fraud department , when I disputed a transaction 2 weeks ago, and now you finally decide to fix it, how about letting your customer know you shut down their debit card instead of letting them find out in public.  No email...no phone call...you suck.  0 NPS.
Is Victoria's Secret an alternate dimension, or something. That's what it feels like. And there's no signal in here, but there is everywhere else in the mall.

@RiotL4T3NCY @Mortdog Turning a team score of 2-14 from complete loss, tilt and no communication into a team that worked together in the end. Myself and 2 other members remained positive and gave our all, eventually the others followed, this game promoted me into platinum for the first time. 👌🏼
There’s no signal in this bitch
@selenagomezsax @selenagomez Cape Town = Load shedding = no internet connectivity😭😭
@mattliebowitz @ATT Seriously, though...all these years, I've been paying ATT for "Cell phone service" while all I've had was the grace of broadband service??? No internet connection, no cell coverage. What exactly was I paying for?

Guess everyone was a fan

@R0zzyB0wden @JuddLegum It’s not just Facebook. It’s the dominant cyberlibertarian credo of Silicon Valley. Barlow published the playbook back in 1996–The Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace.

@OsirisTenkuryuu The game we played when we had no internet at the time 😭😭
@bt_uk Already ran the checks and it’s an issue outside the home. It says estimated fix of Wednesday, no internet that whole time?
Not only is government NOT the problem, it’s actually the only tool we have to combat the largest problems facing man-kind. We can not tackle things like climate change, poverty, etc.. without it. Without the government there would be no internet, GPS, society as we know it.
@martolinakiwi @LATAM_PER I'm in the same line. Since 10:30am and now 2:49. No communication from @LATAM_PER to passengers in line. Safety is one thing; customer service is another.

Received an email from a temp agency last night for a great short term assignment. I replied with my updated resume &amp; availability. And then today...nothing. No email reply. No phone call. You are a piece of meat to temp agencies. I got my hopes up for nothing. Feeling the sting.

Really bummed my @JeffreeStar halloween mystery box got cancelled somehow. Went from having a pending charge on my bank account to not having a charge at all. No communication about it either. :(
@CSGOEmpireV2 @sync1080p @_Sliced_ Yeah it's a learning curveball with this CS system but yh your system will improve but your customer service to high rollers won't improve and communication within your support team. When I worked for you for two years it was really disorganized, no communication between teams
@SKYserves Youre testing my patience again. There is still no internet as of this day! Location is not even on the list.
@NeedsAManDuh_ @_sabrinalana_ @lexitherealone @saul_rubio10 @RashidaZakiya @gabbshyphy @xberryhes @kyleeeeannn @itsthahope @keIseazy @LandonBagby @siimplyjayy Okay so.

I’m ready for this era or whatever that I get to meet y’all.
@gram63 @BBCRadio3 *runs up and down boat hysterically at the thought of no internet...again*
@IndiGo6E our flight (Bombay to Delhi) has been delayed. No communication and heads up given to us about this.
@_woollyback @RokoshME @united_roll @Lumberist So although I see the need to reduce, I also see that we are improving. If you want to help so desperately you might want to look at what you can do, no internet, no phone, no fridge, no runners, no synthetic fibres,canoes, bikes, trains, cars etc! We still need to live
This guy just cut in front of me w no signal and then proceeded to go UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT WHY
no phone really got me out here communicating with people on this old ass pc.....oh man 😂
Things I like and dislike about Night Shift Like :Less people to deal with No Managment Dislike :Little to no communication with coworkers and boss. Little to no resources.
@virginmedia  absolute disgraceful service and appalled for any customer. No internet since 7am, 3 phone calls later in excess of 40mins waiting and the resolution is a new hub to be delivered. Shock can’t get it until Tuesday. Looks like SKY @skytv_ is going to get my custom
@kohiyote when the day comes where I need to look at furry porn in a Target with no phone data, I'll remember your brave words

@paul_winginit You can’t get a signal because of the train or because no signal even exists outside of the train ?
@_thedrrew Live the life! No phone, just a couple mfs living in the moment 😂
Put my order in for fibre broadband with @VodafoneUK nearly 6 weeks ago! Was meant to go live today (for the third time) but surprise surprise... still no internet. Steer clear. #fibre #broadband #internet
The higher education system in the UK is a joke. No support, no communication, completely elitist. I want to learn and grow and go on to be qualified for my dream job but it seems like an impossible task unless I suddenly win thousands on the lottery🤷🏻‍♀️
@dhh I stumbled on them while searching for a sketchy guy I knew 20 years ago who has no Internet presence but apparently a couple of DUIs.I paid them $1 for the 7-day trial membership and canceled it right away as it seems they won't actually provide the extra info they promise.

Before the communication shutdown, things were looking up for young Kashmiri entrepreneurs. Now, with funds drying up and no internet, more than 100 startups in the valley have had to put the brakes on their dreams. https://t.co/AvAEqTAN5P
@NippySweetyLass Yeah, but there's no Internet in woods and therefore, no Twitter for him to throw around his wisdom...
There should be no phones so you don't bitch why there is no faculty in your deptt. There should be no phone so you wouldn't shoot what ABVP does in your campuses. There shouldn't be phone so you don't post your grievances with SSC on twitter. There shouldn't be phone at all.
@Walmart @Apple to the labs or hire labs to find the problem or better yet constantly check whether their are loop holes were china or usa ir havkers can penetrate it also when power went out in northern cali i found i had no wifi no phone no lights how will thst work

@phattuck @drawandstrike @drawandstrike jinxed it. No phone book, no action.
So we’re $100 out right now, and have had to deal with no internet, a rude @BestBuy employee, false claims on @NETGEAR s website, and just pure frustration. This week has already been so emotionally draining and we really didn’t deserve to have to go through this.
@VirginMediaIE No internet access on my WiFi (again) and your customer care line is constantly engaged. Explanation please?

No communication, no updates, and then no help with flights the next day. Cant see how they didn't see the crew issue potentially being a problem - could have allowed passengers to make other arrangements earlier. Pretty dreadful 2/2.

@JohnLegere No phone
@robreiner @jenelr I totally agree. On a less serious note, I could hear Archie saying “They don’t impeach a president over no phone call Meathead.” Carroll O’Connor is gone on but I can tell you AllIn The Family was the greatest show of all time. No one could play Archie like Carroll O’Connor.
@ATTHelp my technician has not showed up to my scheduled appointment with no phone call. Glad i took off work...
Let's talk about services the Lebanese state provides to its citizens:Water? Barely Health care? A big NoInternet? Slowest in the worldElectricity? NoInfrastructure? NoQs arise to where did international loan money go &amp; why shld citizens pay taxes w/o receiving services?

@KingFrench23 @ImDukeDennis yo honestly this is true. 2k jus took their event away without even syaing the future of it. if fortnite disables a mode u can see at the bottom of ur main screen that its being checked on and is being looked at. we get no communication back towards us.
3. Morning routine. Wake up, meditate, cold shower, no phone usage, journal &amp; hit the gym.
Interesting how things come to a halt when the internet is down. Heard someone crashed into a major wiring hub and they don't know when it'll be fixed. No internet in an entire city. Fun times.
@johnsolomonbain @ToryAmerican @QueenSeraphine I lived a good part of my childhood in a farm back in Ukraine. Life was hard as hell for my grand parents who lived there, especially during the winter. There was often no electricity, no running water, no phone and no TV. Now I live in a city. Guess where its easier?

We can if you want. I’m not sure what the drugs are for, but I have a brain wave reader and can control a single bifurcated axis fairly reliably with a 15 second lead time. We can also play the google “no internet connection dinosaur page” via blinking. What else do you want? https://t.co/6lYeKuqCiV
I Honestly Need A Break From Reality and everyone ... I’m talking bout no phone no nothing
@theingthing In this instance, as the customer is on the edge of that cell, network service deteriorates and can result in intermittent service. Naturally, if both the primary and neighboring secondary cells are powerless, there is no signal at all.

One time, when I was in college, my dad and I got in a fight over the phone and my dumb ass hung up on him. He DISCONNECTED my cell phone. I was across the country...with no phone. Never did that again 💀

@VodafoneUK what happens when you guarantee a date for broadband connection and fail to deliver? Asking on behalf of a family member who’s been waiting over 5 weeks now. Is your ‘guarantee’ meaningless? And no they can’t message you personally because they have no internet!
@OpenreachHelp 3 weeks and counting of no internet at our new address. How hard can it be to get an ENGINEER TO SHOW UP. They say moving house is one of the most stressful things you do in a lifetime, well you have added to that ten times over. Thanks, truly.

@revuwution i see!!! i was kinda a joke when i started. was 9, libraries had no internet, learnt BASIC from a 15 year old book,
@Trutherbotanyo2 I certainly am. All day bike rides with no phone, no fear of 'what if...'; not being constantly bugged by worried parent: 'Where are you? What time you coming back?' No addiction to sharing your every move with your 'followers' on social media. Just out and enjoying the day.
U meet someone. You 2 get close. It’s all great for a while. Then someone stops trying. Talk less. Awkward conv. The drifting. No communication whatsoever. Memories start 2 fade. Then that person u know becomes the person u KNEW. That’s how is usually goes, right? Sad isn’t it.
Guys I know how to fix the 3 no signal !You just turn/switch your phone off then switch it back on again! This worked for me and I tried it with my mum so I think it fight work for other people!
@LizSpeidel @AncientLitDude Times havd changed drastically and not for the better. When I was in my twenties (Lincoln was in office!), there was no internet, cell phones or SM:) if a guy wanted to get in your pants, he had to impress you. If they still do, they still do for me! 😉Stand your ground!

@ThreeUK So I have service back after going to/from airplane mode, but no WiFi calling. I've seen no official mention from @ThreeUK of issues remaining. Is that a known issue? I get no signal at home or work so WiFi calling is essential to me
No phone call. It’s okay we only like Chips Ahoy Chewy here anyways 🖕🏿
@Cricketnation Your rep said that I had no signal anywhere because a tower was down. A week later with no signal still I called your tech support. There were no towers down. Your rep lied. I don't trust your company at all.
@virginmedia That link seems to be broken. I entered my postcode and it says no known issues. But I have no internet and when I called Virgin the automated service says there is a fault and the lady said it will last till the 24th.

I have no internet game bro... I'm only good in person
@spankysick @kjchaifisch @chronic No phone plan? And google voice when you are connected to wifi, out and about? There are many reasons. Being able to call 911 and get emergency alerts via Cellular without paying is beneficial.
Then, after doing this, I go back to place order screen only to be told I have no internet connection. I then go out completely to attempt again and am told I already have a purchase in process. I go in again and my cart is empty. What's going on? And now I have nothing.

@AndroidAuth @adityude You're right there's no phone with radar already in the phone but the app has been out for a very long time and it's not as good as it could be and the pixel is very similar to the app. Why buy something you could get for free on a better device?
@ClnHz I think it is worth a try, especially if you explain why no internet (no radio links, no cables, no satellites)...

@Fozziebear17 @ReadingFC @pnefc Trouble is there is only one number to ring. I could book online but you don't get the discount if you book online and I can't get hold of anybody to speak to. I even rang the hotel who were taking a message round to them but still no phone call :(

time to study no phone
@jcasmon That’s about where I’m at with it too. I don’t recall floppy disks being the height of security when they were commonplace, but I get why it would work now (since access to computers that would be able to utilize them &amp; have no internet connection are minimal).

@Sarah_Kelly678 @AshCashmore You and I clearly aren’t going to see eye to eye.  Just because you’ve had situations that worked out doesn’t mean the parents who don’t show don’t want to Have parents with no communication because they are hiding from ICE raids... promise you they “want to”
@TfL Thanks, Dee. Unfortunately I've just wasted another 20 minutes filling out that form which it won't accept because there isn't a valid "Station" option. I'd seen that form before but noted it said it couldn't be used for Refunds. There are also no phone options for my complaint

No mother is perfect, only human.  To be judged, ridiculed, and estranged from your own children, I feel to be the deepest pain to endure.  I do not know what I've done.  No explanation, no communication, and no love for sure. This is slowly killing me, and they have no idea.

No internet and trolley card machine not working on train from Dublin to Cork. Does @IrishRail set out to intentionally make the train so unattractive that people simply drive instead? Or do they simply not give a crap? https://t.co/PbqZN51e8s

@gregwrightYP Thank you. I am really worried what may happen after the review. Time for settlement? I have letter stating not taking any tax payers house. But what will happen? Financial charge will be just as bad. Will lose jobs. What are they planning, no communication. So stressful.

@MattTarrant @NBN_Australia We've been in our house 4 months too and the exact same thing has happened no internet
@ThreeUKSupport No signal or data here in Glasgow. Serious, this is getting ridiculous. And yes, I've tried turning it off and on again and frankly, at this point it's getting offensive that you're blaming this on customers.
@virginmedia I have rebooted and it still not connecting to phones. iPads or Alexa. Just says “No internet connection”
@VodafoneIN was talking to someone on a call a couple of minutes ago and call got disconnected in between as NO SIGNAL appeared and network bars gone to ❌Happening so many times daily!

@AskPlayStation But an offline PS4, no internet connection, knows the online PS4 has signed in with the same account. How is my offline PS4 receiving the notification that I signed in with the same account somewhere else? Is someone pushing internet into my console or is there a backdoor?

We've been in our house for four months with no internet thanks to @NBN_Australia - it was meant to be ready to go on Wednesday. They have now updated that date, to the end of January 2020. Has there ever been a "business" as pathetic as NBN?

@virginmedia what is happening? No phone line or broadband services working!  Guy updated the cables on the 15th October. #poorservice
@ThreeUK network is embarrassing. From 8-4 Monday@to Friday I have no signal in the city!!! I never get signal at home. As for 3G what is it. Must be a way I can get out of my contract and change networks as this is a total waste of time and money each month. Get in touch

@VodafoneIN @Idea whats the use of paying you money every month when even basic call signal is not there. the network load is also not there to explain no signal even for calling forget data. Please improve atleast basic call coverage.
phoneless and this shit aggravating me so bad
@SatonmyButt @virginmedia We've had no internet from @EE and dodgy 4g from @ThreeUK apparently it's to do with the new 5g network. EE sent a token engineer to pretend to fiddle with some "crossed wires" my kids will mutiny today if it's not fixed.
@Habs_ The no signal is probably deliberate 😋😋😋
Saw someone sharing a modified version of the photo with the "I am not XX, I am Malaysian" except they replaced Others with a clown. Fuck you to the seven pits of hell I hope your car breaks down where you get no signal and your wallet is always full of *only* 5 cent coins.

#Cellphones being thinner is major screwup by phone makers. No room 2 add RF port on back of phone 2 use portable external antenna, &amp; boost signals on d go. How many of u have fits of anger @ phone co's due 2 low and slow signal from cell towers? 5G useless if no signal comes in.

If you ever really don’t know what to do with yourself because you’re like “fuck it all” I think sometimes it’s a good idea to go to a public place with no phone and read a book. Mild sociability, learning. It’s better than nothing.

@avg8 @GuitarSith @rwyjunior @paige_reale @CassieJFox @HotmaiBill @tricia62673 @oakgiraffes @offroadrj Using available wifi, log into news sources and download the content to take home and read offline (we had no internet yet) , even now 80% don't have access to Fiber  but I got it because I am right on the highway, so I have everything now, except Cellular service .
@VerizonSupport Just tried it and it still went to being a red globe still no internet
@AskLyft why am I not able to get assistance from you? This is pretty shameful. Charging me fees because a driver doesn't show? Absolutely ludicrous. No phone number to call? I guess I'll switch to @Uber
@lyft I'm pretty irritated that I cannot reach out to someone for assistance when you charge me for a no show fee. No phone number for customer support? Even Walmart has a phone number. I was standing on the sidewalk watching the driver circle the block before leaving.
So this is how it feels to be single single. Not one text in my messages, no phone calls, no fuckery. Thank u don’t come again
@SkyHelpTeam Really as far as High Wycombe as no internet at all still so what’s wrong with our areas ? We want refunds ? £40 a month for your WiFi and internet and now it cuts off for a whole day and you don’t even answer the phone to customers

More than 24 hours and counting. No internet again. Lol. This happens every month. @Converge_CSU

@matthewfleming @Da3LeggedFreak @TheDivisionGame If you matchmake for a raid chances of you getting a completion is slim to none , most players quit after a few fails on a boss, plus there will be no communication. They putting matchmaking in there will not help. Better off going into LFGs to find players
@RyanTheTwit I wont be able to make it. We lost our power due to the nor'Easter we were hit with last night. No power means no internet. Have fun!

@ND_Blue58104 @LeeHolly81 @realDonaldTrump So he wrote a letter? No phone call? Therefore no transcript? Is the publicized letter not enough for you?Letter was insane? I thought it was to the point and bold. Why do you think his letter was insane?
@enjoyGLOBE Your Globe at Home sucks! No internet connection and dial tone since Monday! Your cust rep told it should be back yesterday but still NONE! I called again just now and your cust rep told us you don’t know when it’ll be fixed? WTF! Napakawala ninyong kwenta.

No. Communication and space however is imperative. https://t.co/lhSdYzhaRG
@DAVID_LYNCH you are the one man save for the man with no phone that I ever expected to see on Twitter. You should be in a smoky bar somewhere, communicating by switchboard operator or seance.
GLOBE @talk2GLOBE you are the worst! No internet connection and no dial tone for our landline since Monday! What the heck!
I had issues with Monzo, not freezing account level but not being able to get access to money when I had no phone due to it being in for repair. (And no backup that could accept the app).Issue with the whole failing to store pins and other bits. https://t.co/UG7VxhCLns
Then your cellphone rings. You've kept it, even though there has been no signal in a long time.You remember how to turn on the screen. It's someone from your old life. Your friend? Boss? *Mother*? you can't really recall.You remember how to greet them.
Thanks @CoxHelp @CoxComm third outage this week. No internet or cable, good way to keep customers. No communication there was an outage until after speaking with a chat agent.
No signal, but he was two yards deep in the end zone. GO BRONCOS!
Oh yes and my 10 year old asked me “how did you cope growing up with no mobile phones and no internet and no... TIKTOK!” https://t.co/ZsC5Cj5yN8
3 days no communication? Fck😭
@StevenBeschloss @gotklss2 I want to rob a bank, tell the FBI to get over it, and then be on my merry way. I’ll let you know how that works out for me, unless I’m in prison with no internet access. 🙄
@BattleshipGarcy i wonder what @thaliashadow02 is doing on the anniversary. lowkey hoping she'll be on vacation with no internet

@jimmyfallon #collegeinsixwords Thank God there was no internet! 😅
@WaxPackGods Anyone remember the bogus Will Clark 1985 Topps Olympic card that went around in the 80’s? There was no internet back then of course. As a 15 year old I was fleeced for $18 🤦‍♂️
@AceBurpeeShow The Paddlewheel was the Saturday morning meeting place for a bunch of us guys to decide what we were going to do for the weekend. No internet or cell phones back then. lol
How did You deal with the language? Subtext: How did you satisfy that vital need o[ comrmmication? Or more precisely, an ideological assertion masked by the practical interrogation: there is no communication except in speech.
Slight panic moment: my patio tv told me “weak or no signal” on a black screen. Moving the antenna fixed it. Phew!
@anirbanmahanti No phone will replace a good Camera, but it became a convenient substitute
No power, no internet, no fun. https://t.co/bopHlb6V2F
@GregNorberg Put them in a room with no phone chargers, sit and wait.
@pikvh 😷😷😷 I rather be phoneless
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO COMMUNICATION SKILLS CAN SUCK A FAT ONE
@Shawhelp No internet or cable here all day. What’s up?!!
@VirginAtlantic @Delta Why you guys can’t communicate seeing as you preach about working together. Our flight out of LAS was delayed &amp; Virgin didn’t hold the flight 10 minutes so 10+ are stranded with no communication! Will definitely not be booking with Virgin Holidays again!
Wake up late and have to rush to get to therapy, don't shower, get home and the shower is being used, get told I'll be picked up soon and get told I can shower when I get taken to where we're going.Two hours pass with no communication.I wanna be clean oh my god WHERE'S MY RIDE
Umm @Ask_Spectrum wtf.....no internet and the cable is running like its buffering.  Come on!!
No phone all day; I could get used to this; it's been awhile
Why can’t I play the game offline, for example when on a flight? Racing against the computer requires no internet...
@cuppymusic Anthony Joshua my final answer.... no 50 50, no life line, no phone a friend.
@ZahraElmansoury silence the phone. Most of us naturally raised our hands. He said how uncomfortable we were is how a patient with GAD generally feels, all the time, except there's no phone to silence!
@SaWdAKiNg of course they did &amp; wasn’t no internet that may or may not have documented crazy shit they may or may not have done
@arcade_1up Your customer service is horrible. I have a defective machine yet it clearly says on the screen do not return to store. Poor communication. Better yet, no communication
Dear @iamMVP sir it’s your policy to treat a customer for 5 days NO INTERNET CONNECTION AND NO DIAL TONE? It’s how earn millions of peso from the customer who work hard to earn money to pay the service of your company you run? @PLDTHome @PLDT_Cares @pldt
no internet, marrige twice, telephone CS, IT work, anxiety attacks, paranormal experiences, restaurant *back end*, managing, 24hrs on a greyhound bus trip, climbed a mountain, parents divorce, walked 12 miles in dress shoes *took 4 hrs*, learned to play guitar..

@SJSchauer ok but even if they aren't the same person and even if it was a larger company there's still no excuse for it and I wouldn't want to work in a place where there's no communication going on???
Anyone else awake at 4.30am wondering which is worse...no sleep or no internet? #life

@_prettykea Damn it ain’t even 10; I just wanted to hear the stipulations of the no phone after 10?
the look on his face last night when I told him nga one week ko madula like no communication at all kay may camporal 💔
The tricky part is, even ppl from authority who issued the “no Internet cafe” advice, are not sure if that’s the right call, cuz there’re no written rules. What they’re doing is guessing &amp; risk management—in case one higher official find one unfavorable detail 6/x
@cheshire_cactus Always 24/7 Sometimes to the point of complete whiteout like an old analog tv with shit to no signal. If you want further info google #VisualSnow neurological syndrome. It’s a tough one to understand let alone explain &amp; comes in various intensities &amp; lots of accompanying symptoms
@DrPhil I’m sure the Chrisley’s were glued to their sofa and TV sets today. No phone calls, no visitors and absolutely... no talking. Let’s see what this snitch has to say https://t.co/kRxodX8b30

@wmnshealthcoach @IntactCervix Some are saying they'd rather have cancer but in that way people say 'I'd rather be dead' when something awful happens to them. Which is no signal to shun them as imagine wishing you had cancer over your current state! Compassion is so needed.
October 18, 2019 14th day  @PLDTMyDSL  NO INTERNET CONNECTION AND NO DIAL TONE.                            @PLDT_Cares  @PLDTHome  #PLDTNOINTERNETCINNECTION #PLDTNODIALTONE #PLDTBADSERVICES
@TeaPainUSA I spend the day hiking in the mountains with no signal.... when I come back to civilization this is what I see. It's like they're begging to be removed. That Whitehouse must be in complete chaos.

@metrolaalerts why don’t the drivers communicate with the passengers??? Bus 9802 for starters no communication on why it stop and the audacity to have an attidude to a passenger that got injured. If he does not like customers he is in the wrong work place.
@BillOReilly I took a 5-day raft trip on the Salmon R. in Idaho.  No internet in that area.  When we came out of the wilderness and got gas, USA Today was the only paper there that could tell me I had made a lot of money in the market those 5 days.

@Braddock512 @EA_DICE @Battlefield Can you see what’s going on with Firestorm?  Saying nothing for months, and then finally scrapping/not updating it with no communication in between would be kinda crappy.... if there’s bad news might as well come out with it sooner than later.

@Grumpy_Oldie Stand next to the door so you don’t sleep past your station. Done that pissed so many times, and you always end up somewhere with no signal, no taxis and one street light! Plus an hours wait until the next return train.
@BubbaJDAM I’ve listened on YouTube. There’s no internet by me, so I’m unable to stream anything without WiFi .
@masteromixes @TMobileHelp @cavschris @JohnLegere Yeah I wasn’t having issues before that were noticeable. But they are definitely noticeable now. I’m talking no signal. Zero. Since this started recently I must have accidentally changed a setting. I think it’s fixed now. Driving to Dallas next week so we will see.

My debit card just got denied at the liquor store while trying to buy 3 bottles of wine, a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of vodka. I only brought my debit it, no phone to transfer money, no credit card, no cash. I literally just turned around and left. Then went to a new store.
@HereInTheHollow @PhloggingAnOrse @BBCNews I can't go to the march because of family commitments so  I will retweet any stuff that becomes available. Experience of the previous 1 million march is they will have no phone signal though.
On my @Iberia flight: No internet, not even mobile internet. No power socket, so working time is limited to my battery which is already dead. No phone signals, I can't make phone calls to colleagues. So, I can't work. Ok, then let's relax.
I went home for the past week no cellphone no internet just my reading and journal and I must say it has done wonders for me... I've been in such a rut lately

If anyone has been trying to call/ text me I’m the last two days I’ve been phoneless and all my data erased so anything you’ve sent me was erased 😪 but I’m back! Lol
@JoshuaHiles @TheSmutGeek Ah yes. That argument is what I like to call "bolstering misfortune." The idea that if we deal with it young, it will be easier later.Its false. With no communication or coping mechanisms, it drives us to passive aggression, and serious stress.
Having your car stall with no phone SUCKS. I was so scared. I didn’t know what to do
Sooooo.....No phone. Dropped and blacked out the screen. Working off my iWatch until my new one comes in, so bare with me.

Had to navigate through London using road signs today Bcos Three want to offer me no signal
@ai_jared It would take more than tweets to respond to that. I'm a boomer. The biggest things that happened was that we were fooled that warmongering was over. Remember, no internet or alt-media to find out about regime-changes. Cold war and arms reduction-progress was made.
No internet for a release day, that’s nice 😪
I Fucking hate the wind. Trees are falling left and right and now I have no internet. Now I need to listen to music on my phone while I draw on my computer -_-

@BTCare no internet for 11 days! They lie. They don’t care, they love your money though.
Life it makes me crazy. Also, the privilege to expect internet to be Working continuously all the time. Is a privilege and something I take for granted. That being said I've no internet for the next month.
Would LOVE to go on the programme Hunted to see how far I could get with no phone interaction and limited money etc.
Anyways I'm going back to having no internet so goodbye 🥺 again

@Chime @SZavala1016 @whitannxoxo So what about the people who direct deposit you have accepted but not deposited in the account. What should we send while we are stranded in the middle of nowhere with an infant. No phone due to your app conflicts. No food. No gas and no response from your Customer service.

@AmpsNL @MrFifaPro @Hayk_guy @JonyIveParody @dbrand Don’t make this about Apple users. What I’m saying it that no phone screen protector should be able allow OTHER PEOPLE into your phone. If it compromises biometrics completely, fine, but the phone itself shouldn’t have that flaw. It’s dangerous.
@virginmedia It says no known faults! But still no internet! Tv has come back on now!
No Internet is better than slow internet. 🤮🤮🤮

@garrymoore2 When I was 19 I worked in the US and was there for three and a half months. No mobile phones, no Internet, nothing. I can remember writing one letter to my parents and one to my grandad.
@campmonday It must be a blessing in disguise to have no internet presence sometimes, do you ever miss being relatively unknown?
Appreciate all the support, honestly means the world. I’ll be outta town all weekend with no phone, but more vids to come 🤙🏼
@BritishGas @BritishGasHelp  still no phone call shocking customer service
@erikapprada Whatever you do, do not use Monzo as your main bank. It's one of those that goes great until the day they block you randomly. Then you are in a world of pain.  There's no phone customer service. It may take you weeks to access to your money!
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport I still have no signal what so ever and home alone with 4 small kids I don’t like the fact I don’t have a working phone especially with the amount of money I pay u each month
Hey @verizonfios it really sucks when you come home to no Internet, WiFi, and Cable. What ever the technical problem is please get it together.
@ninsoup I think I found out why. 1. I believe the plus release stopped being produced 2. Family that has no internet connection/data cap. 3. It's way easier for Sega to produce
I need a slight lil get away. No phones, no internet just getting my mind right.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport I have no data and no phone calls I need this to communicate with my family on a daily basis,also is there update on what is happening and it has effect me since last night,you need to sort this out or I'm not paying my bill simple as
@ThreeUKSupport @BBCWatchdog  can you look into what obligation phone providers have to their communicate to customers when a service is down? No service + no communication + sarky tweet = not good customer service! When things go wrong it’s about how you treat customers that matters most.
@EE utterly disgusted! No signal at home for 24hours, having to sit in a lay-by miles from home as I’m oncall! And 2nd iPhone device that’s had issues in the last few months and you’re refusing to do anything, shall be leaving once the contract ends

@ThreeUK Still dont have any service on my phone (my Mum doesnt have any service on her phone either and shes currently in Spain, with no phone thanks to yourselves) Its been off since 1am last night, no calls, no texts, no data...just not good enough!!
No communication at all for a week to the one person you talk to everyday, all day... that's the shit that sucks.
@jtyler220 @tweettruth2me I think 1800s, I wondered why in Colorado that someone didn't take an old ghost town and revive it, have a park-n-ride out of town, park and ride a horse to town, once there no phone, no electricity, less zoning laws, a large garden. The Gov wants to control everything
@virginmedia what is going on 2days with no internet at a premium rate and the earliest u can get here is Saturday it's a fucking joke!
Email down for 2 days, now no internet connection. Forgive my cynicism for thinking @GCHQ has dropped a ball.

@justheretolivef @cutelilragerr After finding this out I wanted to still wanted to know why it stopped just to have a clear Conscience. So I asked her after a year of no communication and turns out that horoscopes not matching where the reason. The END 😂
@VickyFlipFlop @monzo The airline has chared you, not Monzo. Airlines don't process payments in the air (because obviously there is no signal in the air), so to reduce costs they do them in batches on the ground. So it can take a while for them to take it. That is not the fault of Monzo.

@teganandsara The prevalence of phones are the reason I often pass on live music. I am in my forties and I long for the pre-phone days. This show was amazing for so many reasons, the no phone policy among them.  It would be great if all shows were phone-free!
@virginmedia I spoke to the team over a month ago and they told me I would need to contact you before the 16th October which I did last week via message as I was out of the county and had no phone, and have heard nothing back

@ThreeUKSupport @MatthewMorgans Pathetic that no communication was made to your customers, was going to use this tomorrow and then couldn't find it on the app and had to search twitter for any notice of it leaving. Wuntu just gets worse and worse. Waiting for the inevitable "we have better offers coming"🙄

@velobetty @monzo If this is the accounts getting frozen with no communication thing, it's happening to all banks now.  It appears to be some patterns of transactions triggering money-laundering checks and the regulations are pretty draconian.

@virginmedia It's affecting both. There is no internet coming through the hub at all. Base light is flashing green and WiFi light is on solid green. I've checked all cables are connected properly and restarted the hub.

Still no phone signal. 18 hours now @ThreeUK nearly lost a freelance job today.
@scyian @Elise_Thornton That's exactly right. I remember when the "modern phones" came in and everyone was wary because a power cut would mean you had no phone line. Now everyone is accustomed to it. We live out in the country and don't even have an option for an old style, reliable, landline
@virginmedia Why have you NOT answered my tweets in our 'private' conversation?I STILL have NO phone service.What IS the point of setting up private channel if YOU don't use it?Very  UNhappy with you.Please call 07756 766862 URGENTLY or I start FLOOD of anti-VM tweets

@markessien @zojie_ @NaijaFlyingDr You are very wrong Sir! Our population are most likely above 100M. Travel up north to towns that there is no internet.Do you know someone in Abuja doesn't know the man called Abba Kyari? The unlearned are so much that even govt data is below value.
seeing someone just slowly sip their coffee without looking at anything—no laptop, no phone, not even a book—is just so jarring now, and i’m envious
I think Florida driver may be worse than Bahamian drivers cause how tf do you go across 4 lanes of traffic with NO SIGNAL smt

@aristondo_g @byzantinepower Not even that. There was no phone or Internet or printing press.It took 500 years for the schism to materialize, end of 17th century, which jibes with Battle of Vienna 1683.Up until then inter communion continued.
@ThreeUK Mines still not on South Wales no internet and angry kids 😩😩
Well, after over a week with no internet (thanks AT&amp;T), and a few days helping out at Dollywood, I'm home with internet again!  Today is day 20 out of 34 at Dollywood Harvest Celebration, and Lisa was able to get some more painting done while I was there.
Not happy with the #Airtel #Broadband when I required to use internet at that time there will be no internet always need to call customer care give complained get same answer from them it will solve in 24 hours. @Airtel_PresenceAny options which broadband is good for Home.
@wttw @Cynthia__Duke thank you. After many scans and manual adds, the 4 channels are showing up when I click past them, but am getting no signal whatsover.
@ACTFibernet 3rd day and the service is still down. The worst part is there is no communication, their status page looks as good as nothing has happened.Do you guys even bother to respond to your customer requests? Is there any escalation matrix?
@comcastcares I tried that. Your contact us page provides no phone number with which to reach you. Neither does your reply to my initial query where I explicitly asked for a phone number. This only further tells me you are not actually motivated to serve customers.
@yourauntemma If his cognition is toddler level, someone needs to give him a very long timeout with no tv and no phone. Maybe a chore chart with gold star stickers too, to help motivate him 🌟
All now no internet. I’m so close to fucking them off kmt

@ThreeUK Not impressed at all. No communication with customers &amp; the problem is still there. It started at 23:40 last night for me &amp; has had little moments of working ok but still not right 😤
@FachtnaOwen How hideous. I'm so glad there was no internet in my youth. And no mobile phones. It's bad enough now! It makes me sad - sex, drugs &amp; rock n' roll used to be what being young was about.
I just exploded on the @comcast agent who informed me that tomorrow they will send a tech to fix the lines. Three days with no Internet. I am just damn over it. If it's not fixed again, I am cancelling service. This is unacceptable.
@ThreeUK so I tie down to a   2 year contract for 2 phones,I pay my first month then you decide to fucking implode with no signal and not on ounce of customer service to explain it? Absolute shite show of a company,going back to giff gaff stick your bills up you’re arse

@threemob any update on having ‘no’ signal all day!!!!??
Back in the day when there were no mobile phones, many storylines made sense only because characters couldn't talk to one another instantly. If you thought such plots would've vanished by now, you'd be wrong - “No signal” is the new “No phone nearby”:)

The kindness of strangers... Managed to lock myself out of the flat today - no keys, no phone, no wallet, no cash, no coat. Three hours later, after offers of soup, water, coffee &amp; the use of a phone, I'm back in. Could have been worse; I'd only just changed out of my slippers...
@gopsaidwhat @ToniTonit6 @POTUS I love this, but just a heads up: the Print Screen button will take a screenshot for you. You can just Ctrl + V straight onto Twitter. No phone necessary! 😀
No power at home, no internet at the mountain. Still pouring. Not a lot@of work getting done inside or outside today. Unproductive
@Xfinity We have no internet nor cable this morning in the Fountainbleau area near Doral, anyone know why? #nocable
stop using people who are desperate for a new phone for fucken clout lol especially when we all know that you have no phone to really giveaway... sht like this makes me so mad
@ACTFibernet Fast and speedy? No internet here since 2 days and your team has not even acknowledged my complaint."Your ACT Fibernet Request SR10131384366112 is expected to be resolved by  10/17/2019 03:00:00 PM"
Day 13 no phone - obsessively refreshing the postal tracking to see if my phone will arrive in time for my 5am flight tomorrow. I'm fine in a cabin without a phone. Travel these days without a phone is a bit more challenging.
@Xbox Oh yea, its tough solo running and no communication, that is more important than 34 kills. Il take a 11 game win streak over kills anyday. But! I was kinda happy with this one cause im not that good haha.
Travis has been gone for over a week with no phone and he’s still my number one best friend on snap if that tells you how much we usually snap 😂😂

@GDSTeam @HMRCcustomers Cheers for trying. These are old wills pre 1930. https://t.co/CQB3Wf7Mss No phone number for issues just online messaging. Hence my annoyance at delay and repetitive generic reply to any queries
@JCBelfast @ThreeUK how can I call a charity or my crisis team with no signal? 999 are not equipped to deal with that.
#DontUseHermes Appaling service. No means to contact them. No phone number. No customer service.
@SkyUK absolutely disgusted with the service from Sky. Still no internet or TV functions after a month and been told I need to wait another month, shocking

Many @ThreeUK users have reported they have no signal, with Three apparently struggling to get to the bottom of it. #telecoms #networks #outage https://t.co/Y6gpHjvtbc
@CoxHelp @joshr_martinez No internet in Norfolk. I just replaced my router and modem thinking it was them but this happens so frequently.
@ThreeUK I cannot do that on my dongle . Have no internet from 11pm yesterday . This is getting very frustrating because I cannot work without an internet connection which is equal to  wasting money plus losing money
@ThreeUK Quick enough to take your money but watch them run when you try and get something back because of POOR SERVICE. Had no phone or data for 15hrs now and if it wasn’t for the WiFi in the house I’d be lost. What u gonna do @ThreeUKSupport ? #threedown
@youwouldknow Ditto! Just went home because we've had no Internet since 10am! https://t.co/31FfaNzErN

Good afternoon.My ISP has been down since 23:45 last night, and as I use the same provider for my mobile phone, I've had no internet  and have been unable to make calls, which was handy!In the meantime liar Johnson has cooked up a shit Brexit deal, so I'm bloody fuming!
@EquusEngland I am extremely annoyed. I placed an order on Saturday 12th October (5 days ago). To date I have received NO communication from you, no order, nothing. I sent a message to you and I have heard NOTHING. I want to complain. Oh and I will be making paypal aware.

@BaldyNFL @AtlantaFalcons @AZCardinals Making this all the worse, there was play action to Johnson and no one even saw it or reacted. Everyone was bailing at the snap. So we have bad plays called, bad techniques, no communication or adjustments, very little awareness of the ball, and then cap it off with poor tackling
Due to the storm, the Library currently has no internet or WiFi. We will update you when it is back on.
Severally, I have reported this injustice to various Institutions such as; Nigeria Immigration, Egypt embassy in Nigeria &amp; In Egypt, Nigeria embassy in Qatar, Human rights in Qatar including, Global Justice including UN till date no communication till except from Nig. embassy QR

@GLapwing @GregHopper @JoyceWhiteVance @BmoreProgressiv @maddow And no phone or contact with the outside world.
@umidigi Bought the A5 pro from your official store on Aliexpress but 30days now and still no phone
@ThreeUK That might of helped if you had someone working on the network from last night. 11pm onwards I've had no signal to make calls or receive messages and obviously no data. This outage is shocking and the fact that it took you guy till the morning to put up a reply is a liberty
@MummyToTheMax @JCBelfast @ZabrinaN @ThreeUK That's not good &amp; no you wouldn't get through to a landline number, but all mobiles will jump across from your own network to whichever is available if you ring 999, this is the same if your in an area &amp; have no signal you can still call 999 no matter which network your with
@caffeinedad1 I blame Spectrum.  They refuse to service half of my area.  School kids have to go to McDs across state lines to use the Wifi to do homework.  There're hundreds of homes here that can't afford HughesNet's terrible service, so they have no internet.
@MarcSpiritClash @ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK Yh.....no signal for 3-4 hours for me.... No phone calling!!
@ThreeUK I've been rebooting all day. Still no signal.
@KCOMcare I am having issues with my internet. Everything seems fine and then my phone is telling me there is no internet available even though the router is connected and working like normal.
@kleinundrund I didn't have a thread. I had no phone O.O
@shannon_last I taught 8th grade. Email not an issue. Apps, social media, phone addiction, &amp; impulsivity are issues. Monitor closely. No phone in bedroom—especially at night. Make your child earn $$ toward the phone &amp; plan.
@Xythar they come from a very conservative place in america with no internet
Three has been down all day and I'm so glad I'm working from home because the thought of a day at work with no internet on my phone is too horrifying for words
@ThreeUKSupport can you help? Phone is showing no signal emergency calls only in USA
@OptimumHelp is internet down in 11747? Business phones work but no internet
@ThreeUK pay 4 unlimited but no Internet or services all day and it takes till 2pm for me to find anything out about it.
@JCBelfast @serialkillazzs @ThreeUK Not severe at all where did I state that ? What use would a house ohone be to me if I neded to ring someone when I’m out ? What if I can’t afford two lots of bills? What if there’s no phone line even installed in my home and I can’t afford over £100 to have one installed ?
@realDonaldTrump What actually happened:Nancy stands up and says in her "Mom Voice""I have told you again and again that until you clean up your behavior, mister, you have NO phone rights! No Twitter!  Go to your room. While you're at it, clean up that pigsty. Adam and I are tired of you."

@DaveEvanHughes "has no communication" is precluded by my tweet.
@ODEONHelp So you’ve changed the way you communicate these screenings. Last year we were getting emails ahead of each screening. This year we’ve had absolutely no communication regarding limitless - very very poor. We pay all this money and we’ve seen no improvement for limitless users.
We are heartbroken, devastated and disgusted at the treatment Sam is once again receiving from the HSE; no communication, no transparency and no plan going forward.
@clbolt Ok, well for those of us who are selfish, when someone who doesn’t follow back and has no communication except to be combative hijacks my entire TL they get unfollowed and if I STILL can’t get them off my TL bc of everyone interacting with them, I get selfish and they get blocked
@PorkchopSAR Right!! They better back the hell up!  JFK couldn't get us all in one place!  No internet!  Trump has that edge!!
@realDonaldTrump Did some one say "no phone today, you've been a bad boy" and they are making you read and reread your 12pm speech? Threatening you not to go off script? Are you going through Twitter withdrawals? go to jail crooked trump.2 sets of books and taxes, what a FRAUD.

How am I supposed to procrastinate on studying if I have no internet amd my phone isnr working???
@ThreeUK Almost changed phone to Three but as my old phone had stopped working online, had been stuck in the past with no signal when you were down so kept it separate. Did take some digging to find network was down not my just my mifi. Couldn't use laptop without mifi.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport still no signal whatsoever. Just signed up to a new contract and feel pretty annoyed that I've not even been informed of the issue or what you're doing to fix it. Update asap.
I have no Internet and I must tweet.Serially, it went down while I was feeding the cats.I hope these outages are because they're switching everything to the new fiber infrastructure.

No internet after last night’s storm makes for a very bored Bunni. Also doesn’t help that I have werid TFs on the brain and want to delve deep into them.
@HMS_Echo Can't read the pennant but under it 'no signal ' WiFi Broken then? and you are dragging your anchor. (For my life story see flags B and D)
The day I call into work there's no internet at home. Welp

@officialkappa99 @ThreeUK At least its only your internet,i had no phone signal so couldnt get in touch with anyone. They thought i was deid 🤣
I hate the company rn who are setting up glass Fibre in the surrounding area. They cut our line the second time now. Last time I couldn't even call someone for 2 weeks (no internet either). And now the same caseI pay 40 Eur for 16k (get 13k) and it's down often -_-
Being without power is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, no classes so I get to sleep in, on the other, after I sleep in I’ve got all this free time to do almost nothing because I have no power and no internet. So cold showers it is I guess
But the Internet is back, and so I can get to uploading that video that I wanted to upload on freaking Monday and is now very overdue. My work has been curtailed by 2 weeks of no Internet. So has my partner's. It's been ridiculous.
Interestingly, she didn't seem inclined to do anything about this until we contacted our landlord after a week of no Internet to find out wtf was going on. Only then did she actually start working on getting the problem fixed.
@pbaines86 And I though I was having a bad day - no phone thanks to a Three outage and the exhaust dropping off my car. Luckily I got it to the garage becasue breaking down with no phone would have been too much fun for words!!
I wanted to upload my video today but I had no internet, ig I'll do it now

Almost two months of no communication. Wow 😑
@LaurHof11 You just get a generic e-mail to renew? No phone call from your rep? No personal e-mail even? Wow
@mjshrimper It's TV that calls the tune, and the clubs have been stupid enough to cede total control to it for bucks. No one, that's no one, will be surprised if they are not out today. And still no communication.
Got my new phone yayy! Can’t set it up or use it in anyway becuase we’ve had no internet for five days. Boo!! 😩 #talktalkhelpus

@NehaLamba11 I don't mind time........but still I have no communication from themThat's what is pissing me off
@ThreeUK This has been going on for days! The irony being that to report an error you either need to phone (no signal) or log on to their website (no internet).
@CoxHelp no internet in Chesapeake, VA. Is there an outage?
@Cordicon Q hasn't gone anywhere,  just lost communication with us temporarily 😁
@koolovelies slow burn, angst, hurt/comfort, heavy angst, historical setting, mentions of death, whipped wwx, whipped lwj, misunderstandings, no communication, pining, mutual pining, 250k ongoing.
So we have no internet or heat at the office, and a power surge must have killed the fridge. Yay. Giving this half an hour to get sorted and then I'm gone.
@ThreeUKSupport Last night around 11 lost my data no internet can’t use my uber app or navigation 🧭 lost a days money as I do Taxi 🚖 still system is out 24 hours nearly now hope 3 can give compensation

@TheGroveGooner @girlscoutbadger @hidingnparadise @RacismDog are all these folx living in a cave with no internet access and no libraries? that’s the only way you can claim to “not know” about history and the fact is not okay to say italso, there is no such thing as “casual racism”. it’s just called racism 😉
@WolfRewardz I was receiving a dm from you but that time I have no internet for 2 days and seems like I failed the giveaway :’)
I'm kinda up north with barely any reception and no internet.So literally everyone doing these claims on the Reddit post are lying to try to bury my channel, I've never griefed in CTR.... absolutely depressing to see. https://t.co/fUfUq6NxvI
Well, tweeting will likely be limited since there's no wifi in the meeting rooms and in a few of them I have no signal. I'll share the Google doc at some point.
who started the rumor that having no phone can stop me from not paying attention in class https://t.co/MuHlNsHAsb
Kain means no phone#TNTBoysTogetherWeFly @TheTNTBoys @TNTVersions
@littlemore20 That's a good idea, we were all alone with no communication

@flipkartsupport You should end the exchange offer. There is no phone in the world scratch less  after using
@leejwesty @FOSTER_0161 Yeah, I’m fine with WiFi but it’s no go when I’m out. It was showing a signal but also saying no internet connection when trying stuff online.
Welp so much for getting to work early...😳😁😤 Power dip in the building... Lines down.. No internet... No nothing.. Grrrrrrr...
@ThreeUKSupport Three has been going downhill for months. Can’t even get signal in the city centre of the oil capital of Europe on a good day. Absolutely no signal since about 1am and no timeframe provided as to when it’ll be fixed. Useless.
@virginmedia So after @virginmedia cocked up transferring an account into my adult sons own name (he's still no phone, no access to the account) I cancel my own mobile contract too so they send me a bill for an outstanding 42p that needs paying immediately else they'll take further action 🤣 https://t.co/gE336iFMnz

@HitachiHomes Madam no message from Hitachi care and no phone call
Having no phone service today really shows how much I rely on my 4G signal. I’m barely connected to WiFi even while at work, so this is an interesting change of routine.
@vumatel Logged the ticket with my ISP MWEb - MWB12346014. No internet connection yet.
@Teary_Ennui @NotRightRuth In school? Absolutely nothing. (UK, state school 1973 to 1984)The Troubles were in the news a lot during that time.I had to find out for myself what it was about (no internet, no Wikipedia, no Guardian explainers, and I don’t remember seeing a book about it).
Still no signal this is a joke #threedown @ThreeUKSupport
My morning commute was like being in the post-apocalypse. Giant trees in the road, traffic lights out, flooded streets and now no internet at work. Fun day ahead
Seems EE is having real problems.  No signal for more than two weeks in this part of London and now the live chat is closed.
So, no,"Internet of Things" companies will not dominate anything. Platform companies that successfully provide uniform and integrated development experiences across all tiers and scaling from micro-controllers to intelligent network assets to hyper-scale clouds will.

@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport what’s going on 3 !! No internet, no calls, no texts nothing !! Since like midnight ... what am I actually paying for ... sort it out !! And I think we should be compensated for this issue too
@ThreeUK Everyone is saying they’ve had no internet or anything for 9-12 hours. Mine started around 12pm yesterday! I’ve had to use my talktalk internet because I’ve not been able to use my own. Just has three dots for 24 hours 😑 please hurry up &amp; sort it @ThreeUK
@kmckee7 @Eva61166023 Well, Europeans too. Taking a road trip to the "next town" in North Dakota sounds to my this year ears like a stupid idea, but back then, no Internet you know, so let's look on a map, and do it. Somehow, after the border, the numbers on signs started to drop slower, ...

Not sure when this tweet will reach the world, but this is just to say that after an office power cut, we've still no internet connection (Wi-Fi, sure – but no connection to the web). Even my mobile is struggling for signal on @O2. (Actually, why IS reception so bad in London?)
@ThreeUKSupport   no signal at all today..... how am I supposed to run a business?? #appauling
@historygirl27 Was wondering why I've had no signal all morning!
the fucking power is out at my house AND the tower is down so i had no signal so i had to wait til i got to WORK to find out what bbc has done
@Gr4ceyx @ThreeUK Mine ain’t I still have no signal
rah so 3 left man with no signal at all
@robotodd There's only one phone brand that consistently beats them all, which also happens to be the supplier of all those screens: Samsung. No phone out there has a better display than currently on the Note 10. Period. Only to fall behind even more once the S11 comes out with new tech.
@timesofindia Got first hand information from someone who had visited from J&amp;K.  Shops permitted to open just for 2 hrs  6am to 8 am and 2 hrs 6pm-8 pm. Business have either shutdown or on the verge. No internet. Life is a living hell. #KashmirNeedsAttention #Kashmir #KashmirNeedsAVoice
@Suddenlink @SuddenlinkHelp Day 11 with no internet @Suddenlink  @SuddenlinkHelp
My friend Blazej did a weekend where he did nothing that would get him dopamine. So he ate very little, didn’t have coffee or tea, no Internet, just meditation and journaling. Sounds like it could be a nice detox / experiment. I might try that (for like a few hours at first)
21 days since I’ve placed an order for the new 11 pro and still no phone. @Apple just looks like an incompetent company, if Fenty beauty can hold enough stock, Apple has no excuse.
@JioCare I am Using Giga fiber, No internet from last 5 days, logged complaint, ticket closed by customer care with no resolution yet?? Area-Hadapsar, Satav nagar, Pune

@ctvottawa fyi, no signal over the air. Other stations from same tower working ok.
When we’re sharing the @LNER menus around in 1st class like loaves and fishes.And their WiFi is making me register my details 1000’s of times but giving me no internet.Oh hello #BrexitBritain I’ll take my swift demise now. #FirstWorldProblems https://t.co/xWSrXyF9hH
No internet so take care of yourselves whiles I'm not around. 😡
@bitchimJEFF @KawallaButt @yveddevy_ @Chime To be fair - I had an issue similar to this with Huntington a few years ago. No communication whatsoever from them. Not even a twitter update. (Teller couldn't access my money either) As far as bancorp bank being down they also own paypal and  paypal has been working fine
@BBCBenThompson @BBCBreakfast I did - about 0030 &amp; 0230! And both phone and HomeFi® broadband router failed to reconnect. Phone finally connected to 4G just before 1000. Router still showing no signal. I'll try resetting it again... It appears to be working again after 13 hours outage!
@ThreeUKSupport iv still got no signal or data and I'm a carer also suffer with epilepsy so I need it back up and running soon not in a few days I'm having to us a friend's wifi
Rajasthan Day 4: Remote village of Madhogarh, where we stayed in a castle on a hill. Told to imagine we had gone back to 1930s... no internet, phones, hot water, but a fantastic room and stunning views in every direction. https://t.co/mq0ZFoLkLq

@AmazonHelp No, I did shopping and my account was blocked.says wait for opening. it has been 3 days. no communication?
@iD_Mobile_UK Thank you. What rights do we have as consumers in regards to compensation for this outage? It’s been over 12 hours now and I still have no signal on my phone.
@flipkartsupport No update, no replies, no communication whatsoever from flipkart.
@ThreeUKSupport My service has been shocking for 3 months now, in an area with 'good indoor and outdoor coverage' according to the website. But today it has hit new lows, managing a 26 mile journey with no phone signal (thank god for downloaded songs on Spotify) 👎🏻
@IndiGo6E The bag would have landed 12:30 pm today. I am waiting for a confirmation if its on the way or i need to pick it up. There is no communication.Its urgent!! #indigo6e #indigoairlines #help
It's very difficult operating without a phone, but I'm doing it. For those of you wondering why I'm not responding to your texts, it is in fact because I hate you and not because I have no phone. I kid.
@MoneySavingExp Yep, no internet this morning and slow internet now. I thought I ran out of data.
@japhun @Really_Ric @manxiouslife Exactly I have been with Three for over 8 years, and I just switched provider last week. I can no longer stand the lack of data connection in Central London. I work and commute there everyday, and always got no signal .
@EE it’s the third day this week that signal in my area is down. Can’t call you as I’ve got no signal. This needs to be sorted out. I work from home and need signal.
@BritishGas @BritishGasHelp Waiting for a plumber. Text at 1157; ‘your plumber will be with you between 12 &amp; 1215’. Get back by 1210 to find a sorry we missed you card. No phone call, no effort. AWFUL. This is bad customer service.
Drafting and sending emails when I have no internet connection🙄
@cathaypacific @americanair Just had the first leg of our 30+ hour trip cancelled for mechanical failure. No communication whatsoever from airline on next steps, new flights, hotel, etc.Now they want to downgrade us from premium economy to economy? Worst airline experience.
Ok this is a piss tale now. Over 13hrs no signal or data. 😡 #threedown
@cathaypacific @AmericanAir just had the first part of my 30+ hour flight cancelled for mechanical issues. Neither airline has been helpful at all in re-booking. No communication about flights or hotels. I have gold status with American and need to get back to the US for a weddin
@StarHubCares hi, there is no internet at my home. what is going on.this is the 2nd time already
Scolded for mobile addiction, Mumbai girl runs away to Pune; returned to parentshttps://t.co/5bhwTwKo9J
@ThreeUK This is now ridiculous. When will the network be restored? I have no signal at all and it is disrupting my work.
@ThreeUK do you have any updates on when the signal will be up and running again? No signal since 8am this morning.
my house is more boring than school rn, having no internet sucks ass
#ThreeUK would this outage affect my phone, am on holiday in Mallorca, suddenly no signal.
No Internet &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Slow internet
@ThreeUK No emails. No texts and no phone so no contact with anyone outside of my home. Hope there’s not an emergency
@MustardSeedUK @ThreeUK Absolutely, this morning I had no signal whatsoever, restarting the phone got a signal, but no data access. The last one was country wide as well, but didn’t seem to get picked up by journalists.
@mariebudgie1 I had that the other night off Sky. No Internet or land line.
@AppleSupport The message is no signal. https://t.co/bszKzmBBm3
omyghad i swear life is so different when you have no internet access
@MafuYoshida + repeated, if there was no communication they would end up choosing the wrong words at the wrong time... again.❝Wait a freaking second! That's wrong, you're wrong in 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈, you don't know what you say!❞That was not right. +
@mikeynevitt @ThreeUK @EE Good luck with them... 😂 Worst ones. No signal, no customer service, expensive tarrifs.
@ruskin147 @ThreeUK Mine was back about 9:30am in Edinburgh - way better than the last time this happened a few weeks back when I had several days of no internet. Seriously considering changing provider after two big outages.
oh no phone at 3%
@ThreeUK Can't be working that hard ive had no phone since 11pm last night luckily i have sky for wifi so glasgow is suffering aswell thats over 12 hrs ive without a signal
@Ord_Norm_Bloke Do not go with EE! I’ve got no signal half of the time and it’s so so crap with everything else and I’m paying way too much
@markcoxdavies Hmmmmm is this why I had no signal from about midnight until about 9am this morning?! I too was grumbling!!!
Well... the longer I'm with @ThreeUK the more I'm thinking I shouldn't be. I've been looking at the Samsung S10 5G and now I'm thinking I should be looking at it on @EE, better price and I've still got no signal, meaning I have had no signal for 12 hours.
@manxiouslife Maybe so but they should have been on the ball on Twitter etc to update folks.  Piss poor customer service. Of course networks can go down but they need to be on it. The internet is workable but no phone service is bad
@UK_CAA what is happening about automatic refunds for DD from Thomas Cook. No communication from you. Still owed money for a fully paid holiday. Have put a claim in. Still no communication. Some old information. Need update.
@ThreeUK what on earth is happening!? i can't make calls (no signal) and i can't get online - i'm now dependent on wifi!
Tiny delay in going live, no internet atm.https://t.co/rfpB9SGtKg#SmallStreamersConnect#SupportSmallStreamers @SupStreamers@SmallStreamersC@SmallStreamersR@SupportStreamz@SGH_RTs@TwitchTVGaming@Rev_R
@ThreeUK Nearing the end of a contract with you and whilst no 4G in area (Rural), HSDPA (3.5G) has been surprisingly good. Last few days there was no signal at all (very frustrating) until late last night. But 8/10 for overall usage. Shame there's no 4G though.
@ThreeUKSupport I’ve had no signal since last night, no idea if anyone has been trying to contact me. I’m hoping customers will be compensated for this.
This girl was gonna pay for her food with her debit card but they said the system was down, no internet. So I offered to pay for it and she goes “no it’s okay” smh women really ain’t shit lol
@ThreeUK @Fatimaxml123 Shameful response from Three - Pretending that they have had no internet access whatsoever.
@seanyturner @bonusgrooves Same here, using my mobile on Wi-Fi only. Already get no signal where I live so I hadn't actually noticed it was down!
No internet for a month was hell 😅More of the car project... The client liked it enough to expand the scope from an AR viewer to a full-on car configurator. Have to do a bit more decimation and combining materials together to make up for the extra geometry 🤞🤞 https://t.co/yIRINH1laE
That's why today my phone has not been working properly at all, no internet and bad signal all day. https://t.co/ogJu81mESr
@VeldmanHennie @FalkeSA @DornierWines @TRAILza You paid R20 to rent a tag. Results are up. No phone calls / emails received - just social media comments. For R130 you ran 10km on private land trails, had stocked refreshment station on route &amp; at finish, medal, luckydraws #gooddeal
@vumatel power back for 30 min already and no internet in Oakglen
@NBN_Australia is the most disappointing ‘service’... well maybe they tie equally with @yarratrams no communication, no service, no solution. Just pay for something you’ll never get #Melbourne #Australia #sobackward
@LizaChami OK here, no internet where we were. Home again until Friday morning when I leave until Monday again. Sorry my friend, I should have said something to you.
@ANTIKNIFEUK2019 No because there is no communication either way so nothing is working to break through that barrier
oh god theres no signal here
Well fancy that, no phone call (as promised) from @BarclaysBizChat and no call from @BarclaysUK Norwich branch.Time to take my business elsewhere. I’m a satisfied personal customer of @RevolutApp and @AmexUK, so let’s see what their business offerings are like
@ankyrea It won't purely bc there network adapter in my computer is fucked so theres no internet bdbsns gonna go plug it into Ethernet to let it save 😔
2 hour delay, no phone calls..... thanks social media.

This is unacceptable!! I had no signal since 11pm last night! I'm starting to think to look another provider @ThreeUK   #threedown
@slcmof @WBGamesMTL There is absolutely no communication with the fans. Waiting for years? Well, wait as much as you need. What prevents us from giving us an image of a logo or a game? Teaser? we have nothing. I do not understand their marketing company. irritation and nothing more...
@LunchtimeLiveNT @ciarakellydoc I know I always say this but I’m on the road today and I’m with eir and have virtually no signal in rural Ireland, disaster for radio. I’m so sorry
@ThreeUK this is ridiculous.... No signal or service for hours... 😭😭
@webafrica so you guys close my support case without a resolution, no communication, nothing. Then when I ask for a follow up as to what happened you guys just ignore me. Thanks a lot
No internet at means I’m about to milk tf out of my lunch like I work at the Zim Passport office
This is a shame but i don't get why so many customers are whinging and going on about refunds!!?? It's not as if @ThreeUK wanted this to happen,wanted for so many of us to have no signal.Go for a walk, get some fresh air,talk face to face with others😉 and before you know it 😃 https://t.co/Wfyfi8qEU4
So I'm frustrated because:- No communication from my MP- No movement on electoral reform- Piss poor rollout of legal cannabis- No serious plan to move from fossil fuels other than to move them from Alberta to elsewhere via rail or pipe- No regulation on usurious phone bills
@ThreeIreland @ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK I’m currently in The Republic of Ireland and have had no signal/data since last night. Any news on when it will return? Thank you

@Zuku_WeCare AC 173085 paid up 2 hours ago.. no internet. Is there a general problem or is system response time worse than government? And worse still your lines are unreachable. Communication is key to good customer service
@Francesthefoot Yes, plusnet contact open reach and report back. I have had no phone line or WiFi for 10 days, changing provider won't improve my situation but other providers compensation if you have no service after 2 days, but they cost more... 😂
I have no internet! Ahhh! I guess uploading my stories will have to wait until it’s fixed. Damn. Woke up at 6 for nothing. https://t.co/ZfRuQITb0B

Hopefully the internet issues will resolve in the UK and I can do Alchemy Stream today, my home internet is on @ThreeUK and there is no no internet Nationwide at the moment with this service. @ThreeUKSupport hopefully you can fix this fast!
@BAP_94Yjay Hahah ikr, I'd go with no internet too. But- not showering is fine too for me😂For 17 is the same for you. I'd choose to be able to whisper because I'm just that type of guy anyway :D
Have people really gone into meltdown because their network provider is having difficulties and they’ve got no signal?Wow life is really rough

@irbrooks1 I wouldn’t mind coming to stay with you... Daventry for a training course with no phone signal and only freeview tv is not the same. 😂
@TransferWise not recommended. Certified my docs, Accepted my bank transfer, then deactivated my account without notice and not returned my money. Only email, no phone, to inquire. Is this how you run your business? Everyone should be leery of your company.
@WadeFamoc @Really_Ric @manxiouslife Oh damn that’s disappointing. I’m currently with Virgin and when their signal is good, the speed is amazing but some areas have no signal at all which is so frustrating.
@Independent Three has been down for me ever since l started working in Hampstead.My phone has no signal 8hrs of the day
And there you go, the first major bug with #CatalinaOS: the HDMI port on the Mac mini 2018 is kapput. No signal, but OS says it's there as a display... 🤷‍♂️
#threedown I got no phone!
@Draegarth @ThreeUK I can't complain. Normally, I don't have issues.There is one place I go, around 20 days a year, where there's no signal but it's a bit out the way and there isn't much coverage from other networks either.I seldom make calls and I have a backup data plan with another network.
(Only just caught up with what I missed after no internet connection  all night 😠😠😠😠😠 )
@tescomobile Is there any reason my area has suddenly had no signal from you for about 4 days now?
@kendallrowanx I’ve got nothing no internet, no calls shite all. Hope it sorted soon man I get all my work through my phone, so when I leave the house I’m knackered.
Got a reply finally from the phone line, its because the work order had not been completed so thats shit tbh, no internet because the billing side had not been done and 3 days it took to complete what kind of service is this ?
No Internet this morning, I know who the first residential customer of #starlink is going to be, your looking at him ;-)@elonmusk
@BBCWorld Great cash-in by the Catholic church. How are Christians in remoter and poorer families going to use these? No internet or electricity. The Vatican should have given all the money used in crating these to real Christians in need.
@virginmedia Yes, no internet through either, tried rebooting but that hasn't helped.
@Tutor_Eduonix the site is down and I can't access anything. At moments like these, I wish I had the option to download my course's contents so that I could work offline. Whether I were to have no internet, or if the site was down... Any ETA of when it's back online?
@marcjones182 @ThreeUK Got texts n calls no Internet

@iamMVP @PLDT_Cares @PLDTHome what is the escalation process for customer and tech support? I asked to a speak to a supervisor and  a manager but the agent refused to escalate me. When will the "major network trouble" in Alabang be fixed? It's been 5 days of no internet and phone
operation phoneless is complete, however ...

Imagine paying £66 per month to have no signal. No network. Can’t even plan to get to work. Can’t order an Uber. I’ve been having network coverage issues for months but this takes the cake!! @ThreeUK
@elevenseshour_ @Etsy I had no internet at all yesterday as there was a fault...not good with a busy online business...double work today!
No internet atm but I am alive!!!! https://t.co/bPQZBaQJOY
So we are getting hit with a bomb cyclone as we speak! 60mph winds and no internet to boot! We will see how long we have power!
However I have noticed that nobody is actually talking about that concept. There is no communication that is going alongside these protests. I understand where they’re coming from because I’ve chosen to educate myself on it, but if people haven’t done that...

@NickCnf @Silvershill We have a moral obligation, to provide future care, for the mental or physical health they may need as a result of the public service.

If I step out today I will have no signal deep it 🤣 https://t.co/wE3ijWq3TF
@ThreeUK Intermittent implies a service that comes and goes at irregular intervals. It's been close to 11 hours of no signal now, absolute fucking joke!
@daveirl @noxiousjellyfis @sweetoblivion26 Because you get on a Bus Eireann bus in the middle of nowhere where there's no Internet for the driver's machine to connect to, the money needs to already be on the card.
@ThreeUK Don't we know it my signal was right off this morning and no Internet either hope you get it sorted
@IndiGo6E misplaces my checkin baggage. The Delhi @IndiGo6E staff misses to add the baggage to my ticket. More than 12 hrs and there is no communication made by Indigo. I keep calling and texting but no response from @IndiGo6E . #disappointed #carelessness #unsafe

@RevolutApp I can’t believe I recommended you to friends! My account being held for proof of funds, that has no phone, e mail, and requires me to provide my life story via smart phone. I’m thinking calling police is only option to release my money! I can’t even close account.

@LD_P Yessss nothing worse than having a phone stolen and then still having a two year contract to pay but no phone!
@ThreeUKSupport I’ve had little or no signal since 11am Tuesday, looked on your website to see their was a problem with a local mast and should be fixed in 5 hours. Signal had barely come back and now this? 🙄😠
@syswarren I know. So, since at home you have no internet, you have no internet at work. You got it? 😉

"Perhaps [...] we're more used to medicalized terminology for mental states, and also perhaps because we are in a time with a lot of change and uncertainty. Being able to name feelings might give some comfort and start some conversations." - @lynneguist https://t.co/bDxTMWsbIw
@EE hi 👋 I just wondering is there any issues with the network at the moment? As I literally have no signal what so ever. I’m able send this as using Tesco WiFi
@Hardywolf359 They don't care, non of them do. When O2 updated my local mast they shut the cell down for over a month. I had no phone or internet connection in office. Had to drive 3 mile up road to next cell to retrieve/send emails, phone calls. They gave me a months credit on line rental.
@Rudeboy_Rich @jcampbell_05 @BBCBenThompson @SkyBreakinNews @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport @BBCBreakfast I will never ever go back to Vodafone. I left them in 2016 after 19 years. I’d sooner use a bit of string and some cans. Their customer service was monumentally poor. 3 have been very good until recently, now lots of days with no signal, no apologies. Are they going bust?
@OliHudson1990 @DanChecklin @ThreeUK He can't. He got no internet 😂😂
@Sm0keyBearr @Martinjohnston @ThreeUK Exactly. Its been shit for weeks. I’m freelance I need to be on emails constantly, i was late for my job today because I had no signal for journey planner !

@jjfox123 @BarbaraRich_law @AlessandraAster Very quiet, minimal conversation IMO and definitely no phone calls (the latter is expressly specified). Loud conversation, laughter, playing music or videos all out IMO.
@ThreeUK You've been having these "difficulties" since yesterday.Unacceptable, absolutely no communication with your customers whatsoever.
@MoneySavingExp I constantly have no signal
@ThreeUKSupport It seems a little better now. But generally speaking, over the last month my coverage has been worse than usual. Often find myself with no signal now.
@leemel @ThreeUKSupport Minutes after I posted this, @threeuk's mobile network completely died. No internet all night until the early hours of the morning. #threedown  #threemobile #threeuk where did all the money of your profits go for the last two years. Clearly you stopped investing in London...
@ThreeUK  I seem to be the only one who got a text saying ‘expect disruption in the area...’ got to say, @ThreeUK do a brilliant job, so a few hours no Internet is no biggie #quietniceactually

@ThreeUK Any information about this outage would be great. You are very good at letting us know what you do well but when in trouble it’s radio silence. Unacceptable in this age. 10hrs no signal. #threedown https://t.co/EmnDLHHM6q
I’ve had no signal or anything for 12 hrs https://t.co/fA3ruO8fI7

@ThreeUKSupport Seriously frustrating. No internet. intermittent phone service. Customer services. Not even reachable

No phone call yet 🤔
So Three is down and my WiFi is a piece of shit soooo no internet for me

@svlaimcn @ThreeUK SAME THING W ME my data won’t work and there’s no signal
@KetagalanMedia @praimetiz Children with no internet literacy even be able to access, but hardly to avoid risks protect themselves. That requires more than high school graduated knowledge.Spreading digital literacy and skill is further important than just setting up the channels.
@ThreeUKSupport Well I won’t be upgrading at the end of the year, I get bad signal at home and almost no signal work and now this happens.
@ThreeUKSupport no signal midnight on both my phones. What is going on?

I’ve just spent 4 hours without data. I think, I hope it’s back now. I definitely couldn’t do those no internet challenges as well as I thought I could lol 💀
@ThreeUK not happy at all! No signal whatsoever, no internet at all. Wifi might be saving some of you but im a poor fucker who has my wifi with three 😭 no netflix for me this morning no nothing! #threedown bus wifi is all i have 🚍😭
@joisterconnect  it been 3 week no internet at pune kharadi shop no body is bother to come and fix despite of related calls and mails to customer care facing worst service in my life contact person aniket 9820630030 https://t.co/PhZ9HClhwt
@IsaiahXMills @JayMack3301 @gay_rural @mva1985 @ewarren Don't be obtuse, Isaiah. SOCIETY agrees what "blue" means in a given context and that verbs conjugate based on nouns not adjectives.  Without agreement there can be no communication.
Woke up to no signal, got it back and then lost it. It's just returned but I don't know how long for. This is a rollercoaster of emotions. I was not prepared. If you're reading this... stay strong... be safe #threedown
@ThreeUK some technical difficulties?More like no internet no texts no out going calls and couldn’t receive incoming calls ! Phone has been dead since 9pm last night!! Apologies will not cover this #threedown #threemobile this morning you will be losing some customers incl me 😡
@ThreeUK From about midnights I noticed my phone trying to find service, then when it reconnected my 4g was on but had no internet, how long will it be down as I’m paying money but I can even use what I’m paying for. My 4g is the only internet in the house.
@ThreeUKSupport can yous check whats happening no signal no access to the internet calls or texts my postcode is DN1 1LU
I’ve had literally no signal the whole time we’ve been in London n it’s so frustrating pls.
#threedown not only is my internet connection down but also keep losing the whole service as a whole.... I can deal with no internet while you fix this, but not being able to make or take any calls, and getting "emergency calls only" is an absolute joke 🙄😬🙅🏼‍♀️ https://t.co/75CwG1b2Gc
@ThreeUK Also, no internet service &gt; please check social media.#Potato
@MissRedRage No internet no tv that sucks I get so crazy without internet https://t.co/7PaDLTyaMt

The fact I have to commute with no internet is barbaric. You’ll be hearing from me today @ThreeUKSupport #threedown
@ThreeUKSupport And today no signal at all, or if I’m lucky occasional patches of 3G. And the support site is down too fire good measure. Seeing as I’m consistently not getting what I’m paying for, how do I go about get released from my contract? @ThreeUK @Three_Is_Broken
I’ve had no signal for hours @ThreeUK

@BBCBenThompson @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport @BBCBreakfast 3 phone lines back but still no internet or 4G. Service is internittent and i am told engineers are wirking on it. The entire betwork did fail at 2230 UTC. No known time yet for full fix. Hope that helps.

Does anyone know when the 3 network will be back up as I am unable to  call or text anyone # no signal
@RobloxianHS I wish I could play but there is no internet connection right now
I never watched the video; only saw still images But woke this morning still thinking about the Ajah lady story.If social media wasn't in existence with instant picture sharing, one would have doubted any such event happened at all. If na those old days of no phones,no internet
@BobbieJoHayley @jessbaskervil I’ve had no signal all morning but it’s back on now, is yours?xx
@ThreeUKSupport Morning! Data stopped working around 7am and whenever I try to connect to WiFi my phone tells me there's "no internet connection" despite connecting numerous times before to these networks. When can we expect it all to be sorted?🐥
@UPC_Switzerland Hi i have no internet, phone or tv connection since about 1 hour
@teelatisha All now no signal
@ThreeUK Intermittent service? I've had absolutely no signal since 11 last night in Devon. Would at least be nice to know what's causing it and when it'll be fixed
Very disappointed by @ThreeUK today.Unable to make phone calls,no internet access at all.After 4 years staying with three now it's a right time for me to move on.#threedown #ThreeUK #threenetwork
@airtelindia @Airtel_Presence Neither getting 4g nor 3g in my area even after selecting 4g manually. At times no signal at all
Anyone else in West Sussex that is with Three got no signal!? Is it a nationwide thing!? #Three #ThreeMobile #ThreeDown
Still got no signal come on @ThreeUKSupport fix it ASAP!!! 🤬 https://t.co/DbkzBOlct2
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupportThanks, no really, I really must thank you for the #timemachine back to 1983 when I had #nointernet #nophone #threedown #fail @ITCHFM @RinseFM @1Xtra @KaneFM @SelectorRadio @KissFMUK
@BBCNews it can happen. happened to me from 23:30 last night! I dont know why everyone is making such a big fuss, people just have no patience what so ever! This world is getting worse by the day. how can an #environment be saved with attitudes like this. no signal, Deal with it!
@BBCBreakfast Morning the newtwork was down from last night at 23:00 up to arround 06:00 we didnt have no signal on phone from 06:00 the signal for calling and recive phone was working but no mobile date , i was very upsed abot it do the fact we didnt know about it
@Vodacom No I have received no communication whatsoever
What's going on @ThreeUKSupport no signal all night/day
@ThreeUK It’s been going on for a month. I was Euston Station 2wks ago. I thought it was my new IPhone 11 when there was no signal at all for hours and I checked with others at the station. It only affected 3 customers. And recently hardly any signal at home either! Fix it fast 🤬
@ThreeUK enough is enough! 5 bars and no internet connection for 2 hours. https://t.co/QsUMk4XxOq
@ThreeUKSupport absolute farce this morning... phone connected to network, but no internet services at all. Therefore couldn’t load my weekly bus ticket so had to buy a single. Will you be reimbursing my fare?
Was just about to start shouting about the new #iOS13 update breaking my phone... but actually it’s @ThreeUK that’s down! Awesome 👏🏾 working from home with no phone today 🤷🏼‍♀️
@ThreeUK Extremely unhappy about this. No internet whatsoever. I hope I'm getting compensated for this!
could @Calum5SOS pls complete the mutual today?? even though I won’t know if he does since I have no internet 😭
Been at work since 8 and done nowt.  No internet 😂
@ThreeUKSupport I've been with #three for the best part of 15 years+!! I'm sick of having no signal in basements. What if I'm kidnapped, stuck in a basement &amp; can't even call for help?!! Looks like @EE or @VodafoneUK might be my best bet! #safetyfirst
@ThreeUK I have no signal whatsoever - I have had to logon to Twitter via my work laptop to check what the problem is as I haven't got access to WiFi been at work.
Got home and there is no internet connection. You know that sticker that shows that one fursona slamming his head on a desk. Thats my mood rn.
@iD_Mobile_UK NO SIGNAL THIS IS RIDICULOUS
@ThreeUK No. Internet either. So. Is that an issue too
@ThreeUK need to sort out their current network issues before bringing out 5G !! Poor signal for weeks and now no signal or data 🤬 @ThreeUKSupport any idea of when it will be back up?
@ThreeUKSupport not great not able to text, no internet connection - NOT HAPPY
@ThreeUKSupport Litterally cannot use my phone at all no signal, no data nothing
@ThreeUKSupport hmmm no signal, no data, no calls since 9pm yesterday. When will this be fixed. I hope your going to compensate for the inconvenience your network has caused.
@ThreeUK 12 hours non service. EE ship is rammed as we speak. Been a month if crappy service now. Slow speeds, no signal now this. #leavethreejoinEE
@ThreeUK Not just the UK, am in US for work and no signal or data for around 10 hours here too. I get that things go wrong every now and again, but how you deal with it is critical - no information for 9 hours is not the right way. Tell us what the problem is and when it will be fixed.
This whole morning no internet. Then they’ll come and tell me I should get a new SIM. Nah sort your crap network out
Thank you to everyone who wished me a very good birthday! Sorry i took long to reply. I had no internet yesterday:(  but thank you again everyone! https://t.co/M7kJkCtviq
Gone 10 hours without any internet thanks to @ThreeUK . I couldn’t even google “how to not have a panic attack when u have no internet”. Struggles
Finally @Airtel_Presence won the company&amp;customer battle for not providing services,i was facing NO internet issue from past 10 days,and now finally i have decided to switch to @reliancejio ,thank you my dear freind @ashishcsanghvi for your suggestion.@TRAI @airtelindia #airtel👎🏻
5.30am and no internet. Slight panic. Thought it was my router. Thought it was my iPad. Then thought it was the end of the world. Brain told me network problem, soul died. How did we ever live without the internet before???  #threedown
@DeeApple 🙈😄Honestly I’m ready to move to an island with no internet. This world ain’t for me anymore
@ThreeUKSupport Not that you need more complaints but to let you know, having the same issues up in Aberdeen too since last night. No signal at all or 3/4G. Always just says "searching" or says I'm "offline" even if there is allegedly 4G. 3 App won't work either.
No phone calls and no data! What is going on 3 mobile? 😡
@ThreeUK network used to be so good but I swear to god recently almost every week my internet goes down or I get no signal and I’m constantly having to look online to check network converage. Dunno why I pay £60+ a month for a fucking network that never works properly
@ThreeUKSupport How can we check back here with no signal?
Ha!Ten hours with no internetAs you might gather, it is back on now https://t.co/K4wlUZE8lC
#threedown tough and annoying it needs to be sorted quickly, if an operator has a global outage then this is a genuine concern far greater than no internet, I’m now more worried about my data being secure.
@BBCBenThompson @ThreeUK @BBCBreakfast No signal in Saffron Walden, Essex 😔 all friends on 3 are having issues
@JioCare I was trying to book Uber cab not there is no signal in mobile my family members were trying to call again and again but they are unable to reach me I am disconnected from whole world suddenly.

I want compensation for this. Absolutely ridiculous that I've had no phone network whilst I've been sleeping. We want compensation now. Early upgrade will only be sufficient because you've never been an issue in the past 😂🍻❤ #threedown @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport
@xcarlaxisxmex so i've read online, luckily i was sleeping and connected to wifi. not fun being on a night shift with no internet!

@ThreeUK No signal for 12 days now, ring up just keep getting lied to, hope we are getting refunded

Nice one @ThreeUK , no signal, no data, no communication. Cheers.
@ThreeUKSupport No internet from 11:30 last night as far as I can tell. I use this for my home broadband and work from home so it's a vital service.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport very annoying after 3 years of continuous contract, the service is getting worse day by day. No internet at all, used around 2GB out of 12GB last month. Currently using WiFi :(
Have no internet at my plac right now, I fucking hope it's temporary and it wasn't the drilling on the flat next door breaking some wall cable
@ThreeUKSupport No phone signal whatsoever 🤬
@oringepil Sorry, they can't - no signal...
No phone signal for an hour due to #threedown and it was the longest hour of my life. https://t.co/isvbb4TzxB
I’ve now had no signal for 9 hours 😩 @ThreeUKSupport #threedown
@ThreeUKSupport This is a total joke in this day and age. Almost 12 hours with no phone internet.
@DelboyxTweets This is how I’ve been living, they need to pattern up Kmt. No signal what so ever. https://t.co/UE35B3UVwp
@ThreeUKSupport can you please give us updates as there’s still no signal?
@MrMatRead @IWMTom @mister_surname @ThreeUKSupport Wi-Fi doesn't solve the issue of no signal to make calls and texts. And Wi-Fi is only at home. Not sure why you don't see "the issue". I'm not too bothered about the outage but I can understand it could get really inconvenient for some people.
@ThreeUK Ffs fix up I have no internet service
@ThreeUK Best network for data? I’ve had no signal since last night....
@priyasethibjp @MehboobaMufti @Shehla_Rashid @kavita_krishnan What a joke? U asking will they protest or condemn, but in reality u have cage them and no Internet. A lady protested yesterday, detained by BJP Pro. Anything happens, bjp : will so and so....! Enough of politics of insanity.
Kmt as soon as I get off this train I’ll have no signal. Stupid @ThreeUK
@ThreeUKSupport No phone service at all in all of Aberdeenshire, this is beyond a joke, what compensation will we get for the complete lack of service which you were trying to hide
@TFMRadioNews @ThreeUK i still have no signal
@SkyNews Who cares about bloody ' brexit'  because in 40 years There be no UK, no EU, no earth , due to 'climate change' there be no tube no cars no houses no internet , no people the planet the earth be a dead planet..!
@ThreeUKSupport how long do I have to cancel my SO contract? I joined 3 weeks ago but have no signal anywhere even though I work right in the city centre. I swapped for more data yet I struggle to use anything now I'm on three.
@ThreeUKSupport completely down. I started my commute from Reading to Paddington, all the way no connection, no internet. normally the train is awful for connection with @ThreeUKSupport  but today is a joke.
Digital India😂 .. what a joke.Almost zero network inside or outside the house. No internet. #Delhi @Airtel_Presence #jio @Reliancejio
Today is not my day. My phones got no internet service at all b/c the networks down, my eye and face is swollen up like a golf ball and now there’s a leak in my flat. Sighhhhhhhh
Website down. No phone or email support- even a message. Nothing. No comms....This is a fantastic example of how not to do disaster recovery.#ThreeUK https://t.co/UJKudJ2zsC
@ThreeUKSupport I use my mobile for work i work by driving aroud city unable to start .... who will cover my lost??? Can i cancel contact  without  paying  penalty?? Because you are not  good professional provider without any notice No internet ....
Knbs should pay the enumerators who worked tirelessly in the just concluded census. In Bomet we're in total darkness. No one understands what's going on. No communication from the relevant offices @KNBS
@ThreeUK what's happening! No internet cant make calls, tried your online network issues apparently your doing work! Really poor show, no answer when calling either. I've only got another 17 months to go with you 😥
Having no phone service after the concert was a bloody nightmare couldn’t get hold of my family to let them know I was fine and couldn’t check the bus times 🙄 @ThreeUK
Only I would get stuck on the Eastside, by myself, at 4am , with no phone .... smh
No signal at all for hours now, website unavailable and the signal's been dodgy for months.. this isn't what we are paying for @ThreeUK
@somersetseahawk @ThreeUK 3g started working around 8:30am, but no internet access. Imagine if you had to call 999 not impressed at all. A text message to all customers would have set the right expectation. Their risk manager should get fired !! That's not how you run a business.
No signal 3 is skatty as fuck
From now on whoever I kick it with we need like a no phone policy , mfs can stare at screen in the crib
No internet.By the time you read this, your thoughts and prayers will no longer be needed.
@ThreeUK Only been with you guys less than 3 months, bloody great start!! No phone when working night shift doesn't help if family need me..sort this ASAP!!!!
3 has got to be the worst network!! No signal or 3G since 10oclock last night😡😡😡 #threedown
@VodafoneUK still no internet connection- been 1 week now!
@HowdenJohn Yep.  No phone or 4G service at all
@ThreeUK Not even answering any calls!!! I have no signal at all no voice, no text and no data and it’s not intermittent there’s nothing at all
Ap 🤝 jongensNo communication skills
Whenever you guys talk about eating snacks in bed that’s all I picture. No TV on, no music, no books, no phone.Just you, snacks, and munching sounds.
@emmaxlouise___ Ahhhh so this is why I’m getting the no internet notice on my phone....boss. It’d just done another update as well 😑
@ThreeUKSupport does sending text messages using WiFi still work as it normally would when youve no signal?
@ThreeUKSupport I’ve got no internet since half past ten. So annoying. It is very unlike @ThreeUK #ThreeUK #threedown
@ThreeUKSupport can you assist with the 4g issue i have. No internet atall? https://t.co/3VWkzixGKF
Once I leave yard, no internet until I get to uni 🥴
@Rchaud1 @ThreeUK No internet? Really? In 2019 and you can’t get onto the internet? Pubs, hotels, Starbucks, Costa, loads of places you could take advantage of free Wi-Fi . Unless you have a home based Ethernet only PC,but then you wouldn’t be using three would you ?
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport no signal/data all the way from Crawley to Croydon! When's this going to be fixed? It's clear it's not specific areas and it's you're entire network!
@ThreeUKSupport When is this going to be fixed? I’m in Oz. Bit me and my wife (maybe both not 3 for long) no signal all day. No nav. No way to call home without stopping at McDonald’s WiFi. First denying an issue then accepting there is an issue but with no timescale. #uselessthreenetwork
@ACTFibernet No Internet since 24 hours. Registered a complaint but nobody response from your side. 😒😒😒
@VodafoneUK So I’ve been stressed thinking my phone had been hacked, no signal. Reset my phone to factory settings. All the stress of setting up all my online banking apps and security. Not being able to contact my kids whilst away in Spain and you feel £5 is adequate?
@ThreeUKSupport Hi Three, no signal in North Lincolnshire, come on get on it.
More @ThreeUKSupport problems! Kind of getting used to it now. No internet signal since before midnight! @Three_Is_Broken #5gFailhttps://t.co/31AiP4DVnp
@ThreeUK I think more than an apology you should start improving your services...the intermittent service have been for a while and now suddenly no internet and no connection!! Neither in others cheap countries this happen!!
No signal for voice or data from 5 am this morning??? What’s happening at three??? @ThreeUKSupport
What the hell is happening !!no phone no data.... @ThreeUK
Trying to pick up sadie from the airport with no signal is going to be fun 💀
Hey @ThreeUK &amp; @ThreeUKSupport , any reason why I either have no signal at all in central London this morning? It's been on and off all morning but off fully for the past half hour. It's kind of ridiculous.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport pathetic attempt to fix the network. 9 hours and counting. no signal, data or ability to call. disgrace
@ThreeUK No internet from yesterday 😖And when you try to ring 333 - no answer........
Have to say I laughed a bit reading the suns article this morning about @ThreeUK I am with 3 and get no signal a lot it’s a constant problem but turning my phone off and on again works 🤷🏽‍♀️ why has everyone got to “loose their minds” over it 🤣🤣
@Airtel_Presence @airtelindia Hey.. I'm travelling in Berlin, Germany. I have activated your international roaming pack. There has been no signal this morning (~2 hrs now). The Airtel app isn't helping.Can someone give an update?
Yeh literally got no signal wtf https://t.co/dw6oEgtbhs
@quizclothing @Hermesparcels How is this ‘next day delivery’? Can someone help please? No phone numbers to talk to a person and I want the goods I have paid for. https://t.co/gcJA0Iwd3V
Well it's all kicking off today isnt it. No phone signal across the UK &amp; toffs in suits being dragged off trains and kicked to within an inch of their premium bonds... it's not even 9am yet! I wonder what else the day holds....
@ThreeUK It's been troubling with trains services not working from Euston this morning and trying to figure out how to reach my destination with no internet. Well done 3
@ThreeUK Mine was down since 10 pm last night. NO CALL, NO INTERNET AND NO MESSAGES IN OR OUT. WHAT A JOKE!!!!!
@RVP2020ASAP @Boxing_Exposure Hahah If there was no internet you would be  A NOBODY.
@ThreeUK Considering I was parked on the side of the motorway last night, with no signal, no means of contacting anyone, not even 999 despite it saying emergency calls only... This is of little use to me now. Cheers!
@ThreeUK 9 hours with no signal what a joke !!!!!
So, at 6am this morning I had signal, by the time I got to work 40 minutes later, no signal. #threedown We don't have wifi at work so basically if shit goes down with the kids today I can't respond to our WhatsApp group. Hopefully no one gets punched! @ThreeUKSupport
Yeah it's a bit of a pain that @ThreeUK is down - but these things happen, no phone network is bulletproof. I'm sure it'll be okay eventually.#ThreeDown
No service and no Internet in Upper Holloway area in London for nine hour now @ThreeUKSupport 🤬
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport can we get an explanation of what's happening pls? My phone has no signal at all and I use it for work so I'm already not receiving any clients calls today which means I'm losing income. When will the network be up again pls?
@iD_Mobile_UK does your network have an issue with getting signal today? I’m in Bristol area and have no signal. Just checking it’s not my actual phone
Today there is no internet and I have computational class
@BBCBreakfast About time too. Fuming that they blame customers and our devices when it's literally everyone that can't get on, and when I did have signal (none now) there was no Internet.How they act now will decide whether I demand to leave my contract as my phone is essential as a carer.
@ThreeUK How can we check for updates when we have no internet....
No internet connection for hours. Now been knocked off network. What's going on????? @ThreeUK  #threedown
@ThreeUKSupport My phone network has been down since midnight last night,I have no signal,no internet and can't top up,your website says you are doing essential work,where Timbuktu?
Only me would be on the network that has went down x no phone for me today lol x
@ThreeUK No phone working at all since yesterday , presumably all our bills  will be adjusted accordingly ?  Tried contacting you via your website but it’s not working
@Zuku_WeCare I have given up. Now my decoder has been saying no signal for a week after some rain. Ata kama nimejipeana aje siwezi. This relationship has become abusive and exploitative. :-(
@Mama_Crocker_ I mean I’m not denying it’s not ideal, that’s for sure, but people are complaining at no signal at 1am...Unless it’s an emergency or you work nights, you don’t need your phone at 1am 😂
@iD_Mobile_UK @ThreeUK Just to clarify: I have phone service and my phone can even 'see' 4G, but it can't connect to 4G so no internet. Phone calls and SMS are working.
lool the whole three network is down ffs, no internet all day
@ThreeUKSupport any idea when the network will be up again? No internet since late last night
@ThreeUKSupport No signal AGAIN. This is now a CONSTANT. What am I paying for exactly??
@ThreeUKSupport why do I have no signal or mobile data whatsoever??? Pls sort this ASAP
@ThreeUK my three networks stop working last night 12pm no signal no internet please check and find out what happened to network thanks
@UK_CAA Are automatic refunds still taking place havent had anything,no communication either?
@ThreeUKSupport why have I no signal or internet !?
@BBCBreakfast I'm on ID mobile which runs off Three and no mobile data here too. I have been able to send a text but that is intermittent. It goes between no signal and emergency calls only.  I'm in Sheffield.
Having no internet on #threemobile right before my 4 1/2 hour train ride is dull. #threedown
@LeeCha_Mia @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport This morning I’m using southern eastern WiFi. I’ve had no internet since I left my house.

Am I the only 3 customer with no signal right now ??
@ThreeUK No signal at all in York, this is costing my business money
Ok so now this morning I’ve had NO SIGNAL! 😡 I’m having to use the WiFi on the train just to tweet to you. Ive tried everything and still no internet. What a joke.
The bad news is we had no hot water this morning and I have no phone service, but the good news is the ticket man only charged me for a child ticket so that kinda makes up for it 🤷🏻‍♀️
Come on @ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK sort it out. Got no internet and there was no warning so what's the crack?
My computer says no internet. My modem says all is good..... https://t.co/mghySQGRk9
@ThreeUKSupport I'm having to use a phone on Tesco as a WiFi hot-spot just to post this. I need my phone at the moment and am not happy as it's a lifeline as I'm a carer. I can't be stuck without it. No signal since after 11 last night.
@ThreeUK @Behzinga @_JackFowler_ @WesNelsonUk @NicolaAdamsOBE @CallofDutyUK No internet in Leicester. What is going on @ThreeUKSupport  @ThreeUK
@ThreeUK from Farringdon all the way to Old street no service. At some point i had no signal bars and it was showing: No Service @Three_Is_Broken https://t.co/rITzX8IsxQ
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport Why is there no update on why peoples phones have no signal and no Internet!? Its not just one or two phones now... IT'S EVERYWHERE.
I guess everyone is having problems with @ThreeUK network?! I have no internet on my phone! 😭 @ThreeUKSupport
@ANGERrei Face of man with no internet.Nahh but you look nice dude!
@ThreeUKSupport southampton / hedge endno internet since midnightI just back home and I use wi-fi
@ThreeUKSupport sick of this now. Only just got signal back after almost a month with nothing. Wake up to this and no signal again! It’s appalling service. @Three_Is_Broken https://t.co/g9PqtIpUfn
@ThreeUKSupport I cant make my phone connect to Three at all, no phone signal no data. Do you have any issues in London today? Thanks
@ThreeUKSupport @harj_jhutie No signal along Thames Valley/M4 from West Berskshire to M25
@NathanTrout @ThreeUK Yeah, even when they are "working" they seem to be getting worse, poor or no internet despite strong 4G signal.
thank you everyone who DMed me. not to worry. i don’t have internet at my house cause i live literally on the water and no phone for the moment. here is the view from my dining room okay https://t.co/ra2JjP6Lt2
@ThreeUK what’s happening with your service?!? Your signal in London is always bad but today is no existent! No internet and no service at all since last evening, at least in central/east London!! 🤦‍♀️ are you going to refund your subscription costumers for the lack of service?!?🤔
Had no signal since I woke up for work this morning at 3am and still no signal now, three are shit 😊😊😊
@Hollie_Alexa Is that why I woke up with no signal?😂😂
@ThreeUKSupport What has happened to your signal? I'm in Leicester (LE19) and me and some friends have nothing, and I have friends in Hartlepool (TS25) that also have no signal? Not very happy.
@BBCBenThompson @ThreeUK @BBCBreakfast Yes that is what exactly happened to me and I'm still with no internet and it's coming up emergency calls
@BBCBenThompson just heard your report about 3 network. I had no signal when I checked earlier.  Restarted phone and signal returned immediately. @BBCBreakfast
@ThreeUK frustrating as there's no signal. Had to come home after school run to check my WhatsApp and emails as most of my work communicatiin is via them. On call with 3 support for 30 mins still waiting. Pathetic as nothing has been communicated by three
@ThreeUK this network is a joke. No signal half the time and now absolutely zero updates. #StrikeThree #ImOut
@ThreeUK what is going on I have no signal and 4G? What am I paying for my 4G has been playing up for a couple of days now #sortitout
@ThreeUK I normally have no signal at home, now I have no signal anywhere. Absolute Joke , I will be looking for a new network today, plus I can’t get through to chat or tech help support #threedown #threemobile
@ThreeUK no internet in Bexhill-On-Sea since midnight.. #threedown #ThreeUK #threenetwork
What is going on @ThreeUK ???No phone signal and no information with regards to the expected downtime.
I notice there has been no communication from @ThreeUKSupport or @ThreeUK to their customers as to why the network is down or what they are doing to resolve it?  #threedown #nocommunication
@ThreeUKSupport Literally half of Cambridge now, slow internet even when there is signal, no phone signal in most places - have not had phone signal since last night, the other "three" users I was with also had no signal (all different phones) - it is a common trend I'm seeing with you
@ThreeUKSupport So I have only 3G instead of 4G and no internet connection at all in Manchester City Centre ...  please can you help?
@ThreeUKSupport no signal what so ever, whats going on? 😬
@TheYoungFello Weird, but in a good way.  We were stoners and beer drinkers, but not because it was cool, but because we   had not cell phones, no internet, and especially no social media to tell us what was what.  They will never know that freedom.  I’m still optimistic about our future.
@ThreeUKSupport are there widespread network issues? Writing from bury/Manchester UK. Showing no signal voice or data.
@virginmedia Nope.  I've run all the tests and it says there's no issue.  I have no internet, still though.
Three has completely stopped working - my mobile dongle has no signal and my Mac says there is no “coverage’ - Reading media on phone seems that Three are in a complete mess. https://t.co/LsBSdY7Zoa
@ThreeUKSupport no signal in Central Glasgow.Any idea when this will be sorted?

To be fair, in the years I’ve been on #threemobile this rarely happens, but:1. It’s v.inconvenient if you’re not connected to WiFi all day2. Yes, some of us do need to contactable 3. 999 doesn’t work4. No communication from @ThreeUK informing us how long it will take to fix
@ThreeUKSupport my phone has no data and no signal, it's usually pretty poor coverage but its gone today.
#Threedown #threemobile #ThreeUK @BBCBreakfast No signal since 10.30pm last night near Dunstable Bedfordshire. Switched phone off all last night, dead as dodo this am, no signal at all! Come on Three communicate with long term customers, appalling service!!

What kind of customer support you provide? I am with no internet since 14th instant. I paid upfront upto March 2020 I am your customer since 2013. I demand refund of my amount so that I can migrate to another service provider. ACT acts very arrogantly. @TRAI @jagograhakjago https://t.co/H4yWu3yvEu

@virginmedia According to your app perfect! Vs reality, absolutely nothing, no phone/tv/broadband! I get there might be issues and things break but what is the point telling people to check the app for status when it's wrong? I'm not the only 1 affected - all of my area is down? https://t.co/L3DXbQmJQl

@ThreeUK Network problems not just confined to UK. I'm in the US for work and same issues, no signal or data for 8 hours or so. I accept that things go awry sometimes, but providing no update or information for your customers whatsoever is unforgivably poor service. #threedown
Oh dear @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport no internet in Stoke or Stockport. I got a signal for a few minutes whilst the train passed through Macclesfield on my morning commute, but poor show guys. #SortItOut please
This is the worst network to be a part of. All of yesterday no one in my household had signal. No internet, couldn’t make calls, nothing.We could’ve died &amp; no one would know. @Three_Is_Broken https://t.co/j6QFiovKtn
@ThreeUKSupport loss of internet connection this morning and some patches with no signal at all. Will you be posting a tweet when the issue is repaired? I hope it goes smoothly.

@ThreeUKSupport what’s going on with your network?No phone or internet.
Okay been with Three for years and never had any issues but waking up to no signal and no internet with no explanation wasn't the way I wanted my Thursday to begin #threedown
A little rant here, I have no internet connection at home since sunday and my provider @SKYserves won't bring their service team to fix the damn problem they never disclosed about, I'm so mad I'm paying my internet bills timely and this is what I get in return 🤬🤬🤬
@ThreeUK are absolute shit! No internet, unable to call and no updates from them at all!🙄 I want my money back!

@ThreeUK wanna get your shit together and fix up or what? Had no internet since half 11 last night🤪 I don’t pay u for silence x
Who's ever idea it was to allow you to download episodes to your phone on the @netflix app is a genius. Been watching all my shows on these plane rides with no internet. It's great 👌🏽
If I remember correctly, maybe 9 games. No internet access, no demo disks, retailers not getting their shipments and were so pissed they didn't restock when the original allotment sold out (if it did at all)...it was an utter disaster! Really, it's lucky we got it at all.
Over 12hrs now I've had no signal on my phone. Couldn't do my job last night and lost alot of money. No warning or even apology from 3. Shove your contract up your arse, I'm going back to EE

@ThreeUK any chance of a working network anytime soon or even an update to customers left with no signal since 10pm last night??!!
@ThreeUKSupport no internet on Portsmouth and many other areas, don’t you think it would be a good idea to announce this as a problem with a potential fix date/time.
@ThreeUKSupport any update on the technical issue/no signal!?
Morning @ThreeUK where has the network gone. We have had no signal all night and still out. Except this one min. Which is how we sent this tweet. Please let the UK know what’s happening. We can’t work without our network! #threemobile #ThreeUK    #nosignal #threeoutage
@Motor_Depot customer service from the service side is appalling at Birmingham branch. Get told they would call us when they have the turbo in. No phone call for over a month now. So called up to be told they would call back Monday still no phone call. Not happy this is ongoing.
@ThreeUKSupport I’ve literally had no signal all night and still don’t till now. I’m using WiFi to send this tweet! I’m switching networks!!

@ThreeUK I've been having trouble with my data for a while, it is not been meeting what was advertised when I signed my contract and last thing I expected was to wake up today with no signal. I'm paying for a service that your not providing!Please dont lose a customer of 6 years

No power since 10.30 AM. No communication.Expected 2 resume 2.00 PM.Delhi giving 24 hrs power with lowest tarrif. Contrary UP Govt. propose to hike tarrif with such poor quality of supplies. An example of New India. Sad @ptshrikant @myogiadityanath @PMOIndia
@ThreeUKSupport I'm sure you're already very much aware, but I struggled to get any signal at all this morning and still have no internet signal!

@suraj_vinay @bainjal @ShashiTharoor @ShaziaAttaMarri Partial cell phone service restored after 74 days that too after pakistan led world pressure. No internet service, cell phone service not fully restored. No school for kids for 75 days. No normalcy, what is endia hiding?
Over 8 hours on emergency calls only with no signal or 4g? We better be compensated for this @ThreeUK  I'm losing money.
@BBCBenThompson @ThreeUK @BBCBreakfast No internet all night and still nothing :/

And yay that I couldn't send those tweets because I suddenly had no signal, now having to use tram WiFi.
@ThreeUKSupport no signal/internet since last night, what is going on?? Not impress.
@ThreeUK couldn’t even use maps to get to university this morning... three hours of no signal. Brilliant!
@spectraloats I would but I have no internet lmao
I have no internet or mobile signal. Back to the dark ages for me. Thanks Three.
@d4rce @ThreeUK @raye @Vikkstar123 @Freestyleandrew @LivCookefs And they've got no phone number to call 24 7 in case the network goes down like last night from 12 till now at 8.
@ThreeUKSupport  what’s going on?? No signal since 11.30pm last night. Due for upgrade next month, think I know who I won’t be going with 🙄
@Jared_Greenall @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport No internet since yesterday afternoon 😱😱😱 I’m at Heathrow now and still nothing, relying on WiFi
@YODaunte I agree 100% but when it comes to medical equipment, technology these days has saved soooooo many lives in so many different ways... thats one thing ppl should be thankful for. But id so be down for a phoneless, tv-less life.
@ThreeUK six chats/ calls to you yesterday as unable to log into your updated app.  Still not able despite you sending me numerous temporary passwords. No signal either today.  Really frustrating #threemobile #ThreeUK

@ThreeUKSupport I have no signal today and no 3G internet connection - is this a unique thing or widespread? Can’t get on your website either.
@ThreeUK I have got no internet on my phone. Can you please let me know, what is happening??
@AmazonHelp As of this morning when I left for work, it was a completely blank screen with "no signal" on the TVI've left it unplugged, I'll see what it's like when I return home 👍
@ThreeUK can you let us know if here in forest Hill SE23 where we have no phone service at all, is this because of works in Hither Green and how long we’ll be affected?? Urgent please!!
No phone signal at all, extinction rebellions making commuting to the wharf near impossible. Happy Thursday everyone 😁😁
@justaddScott Yep, and also in so many areas of the country there's only 1 or 2 choices of ISP. Because there's zero competition, there's no incentive to provide quality service if someone's choice is bad internet or no internet at all. We need to break up the oligopolies.
@IrwinTessa @GMB Hopefully she’s on the tube on her way to uni with no signal &amp; will contact you soon
@Jared_Greenall @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK nothing in huddersfield. Can we have some idea ease as to what's happening? Sounds like it's been going on a while with no communication from you guys.....
@ThreeUK Is Three network down?? I have no signal at all and neither does my wife, brother, or mother!
@ThreeUK sort your shit out guys. You’re about to lose myself and my entire family as customers. Mass outages that seem to be never ending, no signal inside any buildings, and you guys have just made me late for an interview because I couldn’t check train times. Absolute disgrace
@EE is there a problem with signal around Clacton? Last 2 days I have long periods of no signal
@ThreeUKSupport No internet connectivity in IP2 at the moment &amp; your website is down for maintenance. Known issue? Fix ETA?

@ThreeUKSupport any chance of fixing or at least letting customers know what's wrong with the network? Shoddy service. On nightshift with no phone is hell.
I think the real issue is the complete radio silence for 8 hours.No communication with customers is the real problem. https://t.co/WqfIH72sFL
Back to work after almost two weeks off. No phone signal, ffs @ThreeUKSupport sort it out please. #threedown #findmewifi 🤦🏻‍♀️
@realDonaldTrump Like you have to leave a mad dog so did Pelosi have to leave you. There is no communication possible with you.
@ThreeUKSupport Have Three Fixed Wireless at my wife's flat in SE15. Woke up this morning and there is no signal for the router to connect to. It's been down for at least an hour. She has Three mobile and is only getting a 3G signal.

No signal, can't make calls or send messages since yesterday!!! How quickly is 3 going to get this sorted ??  #three

@ThreeUK  what the he’ll is going on. I’ve got 6 contracts with you and non can be used due to no signal. My boyfriend relies on his phone for work and I rely on my sons as he has disabilities. I hope your giving some compensation out as I’m paying around £200 a month to you.
@edcurwen @seanfarrington @three @BBCBenThompson Someone woke up the maintenance chap at last. To be fair, the CEO text him about it at 11pm, but the guy had no signal so...
They’re not playing with the no phone policy
Fluctuating signals + no internet for the ENTIRE morning.It’s no wonder they offer the best data plans, because you can never use it!
No internet since today morning. Been relying on wifi since. I still don’t understand why I’m with @ThreeUK
@ThreeUKSupport  no signal, link doesn’t work, what’s the contingency plan here? https://t.co/s0kgLIux3N

@ThreeUKSupport outage in Durham! Says SIM not provisioned. When will this be fixed? I have no data and no signal!
@BBCBreakfast It's annoying that theres been no communication about it, but my world isn't ending. Never had any issues with #three so far and they're bound to have technical issues at some point. By far the most pleasant staff to deal with at three, I just renewed off the back of this alone.
Paying £70 a month to three just to have no signal 🙂🤡

@Cerniuk I did this test on a Mac with no internet connection as I’d set the clock forward and didn’t want it to sync back with NTP. The reissued installers for 10.13.6 and 10.14.6 both worked fine, the ones with dying certs failed. 👍

Quoted in Newsweek about ‘nomophobia’. After complaining  here yesterday about the poor use of the word ‘theories’ in a BBC piece, I do want to point out that I didn’t ‘theorize’ about the word— I gave a rather qualified conjecture. 😉https://t.co/O7odPaTcPh

@IndiaPostOffice The postal banking will become popular only if people get services at par with nationalised bank. Gandhidham-370201 lacking in improved postal banking as NO INTERNET BANKING has been allowed and Cheque book facility has not been given to depositors. Pls improve
Does every internet company do regular “maintenance” and “updates” at 2 a.m only to leave us with no internet for an hour UNANNOUNCED (no email, no alert at all) Or is it only my shitty local company? #buckeyebroadband #getbent

@VodafoneIN Can you resolve network issues in South Mumbai. Had no network yesterday. Inspite if your team saying that enough cellsites are there for coverage but such a pathetic service that there was no signal available. Price u r paying for merging with idea.

@HelmSecure Ok, but saying you responded in 4 hours makes it sound like you attempted to resolve my problem, support did not, they simply asked for a serial number, and then another day passed with no communication. When you drop $500, and get a dead box, customers expect communication.
@TheRebelTreble @ThreeUK Maybe they have no internet connection 😂
okay but having no phone attached to me is liiiiberating
@Anna_Soubry But Look how ineffective ChangeUK became.  Better to stay and influence than to leave and become all noise and no signal.

If it isn't written by Cates the tie ins for Absolute Carnage pretty much mean nothing, it's like there is no communication between any of the writers
In an exciting turn of events, looks like I might've just bricked my phone while trying to update its OS—just in time for my trip to @baltimorecomics tomorrow. Excellent timing! Might end up rolling 90s-style at the show—that is, phoneless. (Lordy loo!)
@chrisbritt @Chime Your business practices are horrible. No phone support, no chat support, just holding people money hostage. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH CHIME!!!!!!!
No Phone Week 1. 😭  Friggin Best Buy. Called Geek Squad like hey no replacement, past the 1 or 2 days. System crashed. They can't process any orders and aren't sure when. Smh when even Geek Squad can't fix their own tech issues. 😂😭

@Chime For God’s sake people, you are aware that ANYTHING involving the internet as its framework is subject to having issues like this every so often. Absolutely NO internet related business is immune to this fact. Please try to remain calm. They are working on the issue.
Gotta love people who tell the Insurance Co they phoned you (they didn’t), told the Co they would assess the damage at 9am today (4 hours later - no sign of them &amp; no phone call). Bloody annoyed &amp; I’m really busy tomorrow. Arseholes.

@teksavvy internet sucks.Anyone with a company they like? I’m in 24-48 hour no internet jail cause I missed a month. Which I paid as soon as they emailed me and called! Yet still put me in jail.
@N40066221 @fortnite @ThreeUK I had the exact same thing, I have no internet at the moment so I use my data to play and of course.. it's down. Waited 2 days for fortnite, 3 hours to download update because of shitty data, half an hour for a little update today and now whenever 3 decides to fix up
@brianspitz @storyfireapp Any chance of bringing story fire to consoles, THAT WOULD BE LIT 🔥... mostly on Nintendo switch because there’s no internet browser. I think it would be cool to type in stories,read, and watch on the Nintendo switch.. please consider it 😞
@ThomasGordy3 @jon_prosser I agree. I know the Pixel 4 can upset some people but really that's with any phone. People complain about every change on a phone, and trust me, it's everywhere. I do believe Pixel 4 is not perfect, no phone is, and it's a great phone. Too expensive? Probably a bit, but well made
100% leaving @ThreeUK worst network, I’ve had no signal now no data for hours

@Chime @Chime Your business practices are horrible. No phone support, no chat support, just holding people money hostage. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH CHIME!!!!!!!
@IPostWTFILike Thinking about a time past when all I had in Life was an ex girlfriend, booze and a playstation. Living in a broken down share house full of alcoholics and strange usually ethnic people. Late nineties no internet and so depressing. I enjoyed the games they were brilliant.
@ATTHelp my father, he’s blind. He’s also physically handicapped and has a pacemaker (can’t use cell). Day 3 of no phone service and have spent nearly 100 hours going through the various “customer service” departments with no luck. Awful.
@Chime this such embarrassment for so called bank. You left families and people stranded without their money with no branches no communication other then a copy and paste. @orlandosentinel @CNNBusiness @WESH @WESHMeredith @TMainolfiWESH @TMainolfiWESH @MSNBC @jimcramer
@LincolnOWH What's wrong with the radio station? No signal.
@AMCHelps No communication from staff.
@Chime I'm stranded due to the fact you guys have my money hostage. No phone support not even a heads up that this was going on I found out via Twitter. I promise I'll use every social media platform to make sure no one else does Business with chime! Totally unacceptable.
Got no internet so will spazzz here

@Ladylottebot I’m in Washington DC travelling and have no network what so ever even when I try and connect to a different provider. How do I get around a city so big that I’ve never been to before with no phone signal 😩.

@DavidGParsons PC is still at the old house (literally the only thing in the old house) and I'm at the new house with no internet. So probably bed because I plan on getting up early and being productive 😆
@FLOWJamaica Might as well drop some credit too since you've been dropping calls ALL. DAY.Furthermore, as of 5:50PM today I have been unable to make or receive calls. Same thing happened on Monday. No internet at my house since Saturday either. The situation is becoming untenable.
IT IS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO PLEASE PEOPLE..COMPULSIVE PERSONALITIES...NO COMMUNICATION..IT GETS EXHAUSTING

@ThreeUK what’s going on with your network? I’m in Washington DC and having serious problems accessing the network. Trying to get around a city I’ve never visited with no phone signal is a big problem! Sort it out 3!

@Owolabi_Jr @WhatsHub_ * No communication, in the form of a cellphone or an fb? You go out, you walk around, and hope to run into people maybe. Not always effective, but it works, and hey, I'm so not immature, and not wanting to be anyone, but me. Is that simple enough for you darling?
@TMobileHelp First the cellular data stopped working and now I have no signal whatsoever. Restarted my iPhone twice but no difference.

Been phoneless for 4 months. Finally got a phone again today 🙈 it's been a good 4 months.
Christ. No phone for a couple of hours and I miss multiple insane Trump fuckeries. I can't decide whether the claim of American/Roman Empire links or the letter written by a sub-literate chimp sent to a guy about to kill loads of people due to presidential idiocy is 'best'. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
congratulations to the three network for being the biggest joke and causing a NATION WIDE outage! no signal or fuck all!
@ThreeUK is your network down as had no signal since 11.30pm

@ThreeUK no signal here in Newcastle. Cannot receive or make calls or text messages. In fact nothing network related is working. #threemobile #networkdown
@TGP_Ethan why do you get no signal in your house
Paying @ThreeUK £50 a month for no signal, quality that.
Anyone else on @ThreeUK got no signal. Nightmare.
Middle finger up to Three, shittiest phone provider EVER! How is there four bars of signal one moment and then no signal for the next 20 minutes?!!!
@ThreeUKSupport why has my home WiFi stopped working all of a sudden?! No Internet at all!! #ThreeDown
@TwitterBusiness Why am I locked out my account because some one tried to compromise it and I can’t get it back as the email connected to it is no longer valid? I have no phone data to receive a text code so Why am I screwed? Had to make an new account NOT HAPPY with lack of support.
@GothReznor Papa goth: right..., no phone text or call remember
@ThreeUK what's going on with your network? "SIM not provisioned" and no internet? I need your services to work!!!

You really didn’t know how addicted you are to your phone until you have to go 2 days with no internet 🥴
@ThreeUKSupport no signal tonight, only getting emergency calls only,
This was the ideal. But it was mostly the roundabout. There was no leader, everyone wanted to be nice. No communication strategy. That roundabout. #wcic19 https://t.co/VB2fOvIOVh
@kkristimc Well again, he has untreated mental health issues. He has no communication with his family. He needs an intervention from someone. I hope there is someone.

Three mobile is fucked. No signal, twitter says it’s not just me. Also they’ve added a random £80 charge to my account overnight and can’t help with any of this because their systems are down until 3am for maintenance #farce @ThreeUK
Anyone else on three mobile network have no signal all of a sudden? #threeuk #Liverpool
@Ellieeee___x Same in West Sussex, Three mobile, no signal
Imagine running a business BACK BACK in the day. No texting, no calling, NO INTERNET. Just straight HUSTLE on the streets. How many people would still call themselves “Entrepreneurs?”
Why do I have no signal @ThreeUKSupport 😒
@VerizonSupport How do I get help w/no picture (DVR works) &amp; landline? I have the red globe/white WiFi on router (tho phone says no internet
@ASlickDeceiver » tomorrow. [[My pupils are dilated and my voice is reduced to a hypnotizing whisper.]] You won't worry because you don't have to. There's no signal there but my father and I will take care of her. No need to ask more questions, right. . [[She nods. "I trust you, I won't »

"I was gonna say hotspot me sheesh but I got no phone" -cody lmao ffs
Anybody else on @ThreeUK got no signal?
Need a weekend in the sun + no phone
In the space of 30 minutes my phone has cut out on a call 3 times. I’ve had to switch my phone to 3G. @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport I’m tired of constantly having no signal. It’s ridiculous!
@hippxe @FLOWJamaica Restart and it should be fine. I saw no signal for bit but I’m back up now.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport  network is down in Scotland as well, what's happening? No signal &amp; no data on the phone, only getting a connection through the WiFi
Due to no internet at the city field in Gainesville, there will be no live video or stats of tonight's match against Brenau (Ga.). Sorry for the inconvenience, but stayed tuned for updates and postgame. Go Eagles!!! 🦅⚽️

@ThreeUK what's happen the network is down no internet no phone call???
Was that a bout of nomophobia, @LABeachGal1? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a fascinating idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #article thx

@KyrstinBush @JeffreeStar I know that the had no internet all week end due to fires in Cali, so things have been slow. Theyre probably shipping the boxes out individually by size
@ATrinKTVU @zaphodsbud @USGSShakeAlert @GavinNewsom @Cal_OES I lived in Santa Clara, Ca during the Loma Prieta Quake. I’ve never been so scared IN MY LIFE!  The worst part of it was the “not knowing” what was going on because we had no phone, no TV, no Radio and all we could hear were sirens all night.  Frightening!
@ThreeUKSupport come off it no signal?
The stupidity.  Europe is more racist than America.You think they have no internet? No racism in those countries nah?They probably called you a stupid N**** and laughed when you walked away. https://t.co/dDC2AMe52m
Way too much goin on today and I’m just in my room with no internet 🙃
#KidsBornAfter2000WillNeverKnow not being able to get in touch with someone because there's no phone booth around. https://t.co/hwugt4BKM6
@Tesla your customer service is terrible at best. Drop my $80k car off at 8am to have a console installed. Told they will call me and send an Uber no later than 2pm for me to pick up. No phone calls or updates all day. No way to reach anyone at center.
@Marcg306 @pshyco_panda @TheBeardstone @gojizilla29 @madebygoogle Also I literally said the iPhone has been in development since last year as it was leaked towards the end so obviously I know a phone isn’t made in a fucking day. You just think I’m an Apple fanboy and want to try and “crush” me. I owe no phone loyalty. I see the similarities.
The terrible feeling of having no internet connection.
No direct lines into the supervisor. They promise to call and they don’t. They keep me waiting on hold for over 1hr and 45mins yesterday alone. Time is money but they don’t care. I have probably spent over 10hours being passed around and still no internet setup - ouch
all day we waited and no one showed up or called, again it happened on Tuesday Oct 15th. You ask to speak to supervisors they don’t call u back you escalate it further and no one calls - Horrible Customer service and still no internet installation
@murderlexx no phone, who dis?
had no internet for the last hour and i lost my mind. but im fine :p
@Chime Glad I didn't have to pay bills today. Although I couldn't really do anything else either. You guys need to give some kind of credit for this outage.Not only that but no one can get in contact with customer service and there has been no communication outside of Twitter. Wth guys
@Rikostoryy Fuck yes if I’m home during the day no signal but at night it’s good 😑😑😑
My long charger and my case made it but still no phone 🙄 if Verizon don’t send me my shittt 🙄

@156Sharknose Loved Lurgan Park with Group A, can't even imagine with Group B!I was telling my friend about Lurgan last week on the rally GB (as he was getting no signal in sweet lamb) about how they handed around the printouts of the stage times and it was the height of communications :)
I honestly just want to disappear to a far far away place no phones, no human contact, no internet. Just me.

@LeNorthSnobby @YankeeSopranooo @debow316 @mklein176 Certainly doesn’t help with the emergence of the smartphone. Growing up in the 2000s Yankee Stadium was so damn deafening no matter what time of year. Part of it certainly was because everyone was into the game. No surfing the internet, no social media, no phone games, etc.
Still no internet!!!
I remember working and being into my music and the internet cut off. Supervisor came and asked me if my computer was up and the nigga jumped out of me. I said “I ain’t got no internet right now”
My son was bad at school his mom text me talking about no phone no tv.. this nigga ain’t going for that 🤣

So I've driven to Quirindi to get service. Currently still have no power, no phone service and no coffee in Werris Creek. No idea when any services will be back :-(
I filed a request for refund with @united for the exact amount of the seat upgrades when I returned. After a lengthy wait, with no communication about anything other than that the request had been received, I contacted them again to learn my request had been denied./5

#ProTip for any #writers out there. When building a computer, choose a motherboard without any built-in wireless communication. Get USB Wifi and Bluetooth dongles for that.When it's time to write, take them out and set them aside.No internet, no distractions. Just write.
@googlemaps you need to add an ‘Avoid tunnels’ option. Especially when in a foreign country - tunnels become a huge issue with no phone service and can cause you to easily get way off track. https://t.co/QKAqOdT4FG

@lebara hey guys.Looking at contracts for elderly relative. He’s on PAYG atm but as he uses phone so infrequently he’s in danger of it automatic cutting him off. Do your contracts (cheapest sim only) have a non-use cut off time? Or will it just continue to work with no phone use?

@HoarseWisperer Trump's insane presser, letter to Erdogan and cuss out of Pelosi is stealing the visibility of this announcement right out from under Sanders. No signal boost will help it rise to the surface for air either.Oh well.
@Project_Veritas @CNN Why does Biden mention the 17th. Trump will be in Dallas Texas on the 17th for his rally! Are they planning an event and Biden just slipped? Do we really believe that Biden has no communication with the Renegade. Biden is the dam! If he falls they all follow! Too much to loose!

@ragnarock4455 @Chitoseofficial Got you beat. Back in 1994 or so, when I first played FF6 on SNES I heard there was an online fan site where you could talk about the game. I had NO internet then. Keep in mind, there was no Twitter, Facebook, or anything back then. I wanted to be online and talk to fans so much.

@fras99 A cage in an immigrant detainment facility for life without parole and no internet or tv
@fras99 A cage. Concrete floor. Foil blanket. Inadequate food &amp; no medical care. No phone, air conditioning, or tv. His partners in crime can be in the same cage with him, except for his kids. Keep them in separate cages in different buildings, and never tell him what's become of them.
@Vodacom And yet... no data and thus no internet... smses would not go through / took forever to do so... no / interrupted call service... and now excuses... so the proactive measures weren't so proactive. In fact, they're an outright failure. #stopmakingexcuses #startfixingtheproblems
@charliekirk11 Wasn’t hacked. The info was leaked. Seth Rich leaked the info. We all know this. No internet speed alive today could transfer those files at the speed in which they left the host to their destination. Leak, not hack.
@Wickes thank you for not turning up today between 08:00 and 18:00 with no communication or anything. When will we get notified of the delivery? 😠😠 #poorcustomerservice

@UN when you will wake up Un over 72 days of curfew in Kashmir. Total media blocked no mobiles no internet and 900,000 Indian troops deployed. Your silence mean you are the part of this crio https://t.co/PtwdNDKjPy
That’s why I’m done trying to fix relationships. I’ve always been the person to miss someone and reach out to them again  after we lost communication. But not anymore.

@Fenris198909 @bryggan22 @GhostRecon A lot of people invested in having a PS4 console, so for those with no Internet or desire to play online they are being somewhat defrauded. Why? Because the game has a solo mode. Either Sony or the games companies should be fined for making their games inaccessible to all people.
So... I am in hour 21 now of no internet.. Hows the new Fortnite Season and the Apex Event?
This is a isolated region away from all glamour and lights of the city. The spirituality felt here is on a level of its own. No internet no access to the outside world for 40 days, you spend time in the company of Mufti Mukhtaruddin Shah DB who is a reminder of our Akabir. https://t.co/vngDuecjoK

@mikealbeland We knew trickle-down was a fraud, but unless you'd been close to bankruptcy, the popular perception - no thanks to "experts" of the day - was that bankruptcies were personal failures. We weren't as quick to see corruption then, plus no internet from which to get better info.

I guess the time for lock down was 50, 60,70 years back. No mobile,no internet,no social media. It would not have been anything to chafe about and art 370 could have been abrogated in a most cordial manner.

No internet, no messages, no calls.  #iPhone #iphone4 #iPh https://t.co/S5FXLI1p3Y https://t.co/lOwgDNzfYx
So, my entire village has no electricity, which means no internet to work from home, no water as it gets pumped by electricity, no food (can't get takeaway coz phone doesn't work at home and the restaurants can't cook), no tv... So, I found a  spot on the beach with internet...
#wednesdaymorning #WednesdayMotivation Well I avoided social media but still had an unproductive night. But hey sometimes you start chatting and are surprised at how quickly 7 hours just flies by. But tomorrow no Internet, mean it this time... #WednesdayWisdom #wednesdaythoughts
It’s ridiculous how productive I can be with 2 hours of early morning uninterrupted time. No slack. No phone. No emails. 💪🏼
@sssonku All the time spent with no internet is about to come to fruition. Challenge accepted
Was that a bought of nomophobia, @TopCellularDeal? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a fantastic idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #realworld
@CstZhalovaga @Windermere_VSB @VSB39 @VancouverPD There was no internet when I was in school in the early 1960s and we survived. People talked to each other, kinda a novel idea.
Being alone in a big house with no internet...in a new country...with no friends...is next level depression and anxiety
@GOtvNg I wish to know why my decoder has been showing no signal since morning.
HuhTurning it on the monitors still say no signal even with the gpu in it...

Oh guess what? Still no phone line AND only learned today that @TalkTalk  have been sending engineers to a completely different address AND the Openreach engineer who did the pole work on Monday was useless and connected the wrong wire and it honestly looks like...
Two more meetings to go to, no phone charger with me, Brexit updates to follow on Twitter and battery on 12%... https://t.co/vGuxf58bJy
Just learned that ‘Nomophobia’ means the fear of not having access to a mobile phone... geez the things people get anxiety over today *freaking out as i have low battery*.. 😂
@PsalMissF Lol l totally agree.  People like to do whatever they want like there are no consequences.  They expect everything with little to no work, and they expect understanding with no communication.  All of it amazes me but l will always do what is necessary even if others don't...
@Troubl37 mine does something equally awesome..Goes to sleep,like half a second before I sit back on itthen decides that I have no internet connection and I have to restart.
@UK_CAA Still no email or refund no communication what's so ever
I love when people tell me “they ain’t paying no fuck ass down payment” I’ll be like shit ight no pressure but you leaving the store with NO PHONE 😂😂🤣🤣

@naukarshah Only for 75 minutes? No internet?
I encountered this a few weeks ago but thought it was a glitch in my app of choice. But similar results with other apps seemed suspicious, and some digging said it's an Android issue. No phone interviews means I can't write features. And no features means half of my work, gone.
@FirstNorwich Hi Liam why are all the 23s going g out of service into the city?  No communication from your company to say why and I want a 23 not a 24, completely unacceptable

@DrSundara3 Improvement since then: no phone calls required, after looting private jets takes them to tax heavens without extradition treaties and Govt provides character certificates. Example 'Apna Mehul Bhai'.  Ms. Sitharaman trying to sell rotten apples but 'maaf karo, agey baro'. 🙏

never ever seen more pathetic network than @airtelindia @Airtel_Presence Suddenly sim stops working, no signal. Changed sim, no signal. Meanwhile @reliancejio is working with full signal. I am forced to port to other network, after 10 years. Thanks to awesome service.
Yesterday, after the early morning, I made a rule. We spent the entire day without technology. No phone, computer, tv, radio, tablet...It was probably one of the best days I've had with the kids in awhile.
@Clay_C10 this is a huge indicator of organizational dysfunction. No communication so you basically send a damn SPY in to the coaching staff.

@rahulpandita @Shehla_Rashid Outrage for no internet for 1 month &amp; scrapping of article 370, but no tweets on killing innocent people by your peaceful brothers?
Pence and Pompeo are secretly communicating with the bad guys that’s why they are there,no phone calls ,private meetings 2 on 2 only sure is an expensive phone call
Furious w/ @NETGEAR customer service. They've confirmed my cable modem is defective (only 1/10th the speed it should be), and told me the only way to get a replacement is to mail this one back, and once received, they'll send me a replacement. Meaning a week w/ no internet. WTF?
No signal!!!!!!! Positioning lost!!!!!

@ShashiTharoor @IPUparliament If it's your 'integral part' why 8million people are under continous seize. Why there is no internet in #Kashmir? It's embarrassing to call India as democratic country, it's been reduced to a hindutva fascist regime. Modi is Nazi+Cow. #shameOnTharoor

@MurrToole We really do understand how important it is to keep you connected, even though the work is over a couple of days it doesn't mean you'll have no signal during that time. Do you have WiFi at home to utilise WiFi calling? - Ann-marie
@troovus I don't understand this kind of critique.  Are you supposed to be homeless, carless, jobless, phoneless and destitute before you can have an opinion regarding the climate crisis. PS fuck the monarchy!

I have no phone

@AdobeCare @Adobe @creativecloud okay... why do I have to be connected to the internet in order to work on an Indesign doc? I’m at an eye docs for 3 hours wth no internet access and now I’m completely stuck. Whose bright idea was it to do the programs this way?!

@firefire100 What does that have to do with the price of tea in China? If someone locally made a phone I could use, I'd try to buy it.  As far as I know there are no phone manufacturers in the USA. There are tons of mom and pop shops that are getting run out of business, though.
Idk why people want to know how I’m doing with this breakup ? Like it is what it is . Only thing that hits different is when you really realize that everything was a waste of time  and the “feelings” were fake. No communication no apologies no being amicable 🤷🏾‍♀️

@RepLeeZeldin Considering about 100 years ago there was no penicillin, no air conditioning, average life expectancy around 60, no cars, no air travel, no phone and no Twitter, I’d say we’re doing pretty well.

Contrary to popular belief, the DJ originally came to prominence at a time before online streaming. The DJ would go to a party with no internet (!) &amp; play songs they felt were suitable, leaving the crowd to dance. If you didn't know a song, it was a good thing. History. https://t.co/OtW9myZPPX

I remember I had someone draw a picture for me... he required a deposit fee of 25% of the drawing’s price and I paid 50% bc I knew I’d be buying it. He was 2 weeks late getting me the picture with little to no communication. Had me chasing him so I asked for the 25% deposit back

@Bajaj_Finance It's quite hard to get in touch with you guys and someone else from same company wanted to sell insurance to me!!! Come on people, I have even sent email to speak with you guys but no communication yet.
I'm currently rewatching Death Note because it aired 10 years ago on MTV and there are some episode that I missed (had no internet at the time) but after I'm done I'll definitely look into her spinoff manga, Suzune Magica.I think Nanjolno's voice fits her a lot...

This goes for any relationship romantic, friendships, family relationships. No communication only aids in the growing of bitterness and over thinking, making a situation way worse than before. Talking things out is so therpudic and can help you and the relationship grow. https://t.co/cKSEgXZorK
@AIRTEL_KE It's been 3 days now....no communication from @AIRTEL_KE | should this be be termed as rude or poor customer service. Been calling and systems prompts to be busy. Escalated the same issue on twitter &amp; still no response. I now rest my case.
@shanedawson Oh thanks goodness!! I had to get a loaner car and then I got locked out of said car and everything was inside no phone no purse nothing it was HORRIBLE!  Then to top it off I missed the launch!!  Congrats I’m so excited for you and can’t wait for the restock!!

We lived in tattered tents without electricity and in company of snakes and scorpions with no inkling of where the next meal will come from. Our children didn't skip school and progressed.Now children in #Kashmir won't attend classes coz there is no internet. #idiots
It's a shame to hear that @Google is not launching the new #Pixel4 in India, because of some bloody sensor that can't be used in India. I have been a huge fan of Pixel phones ever since I owned one, and I must tell you no phone can beat the pure Android experience (cont..) https://t.co/0vtmNWPlvx

no communication can lead to sad things you didn’t want to happen 😓
@Airtel_Presence I don’t want to be rude here but we talk about technology and progress. However, there is no internet service in my location for last 3 days and in-fact there is no tsunami, hurricane to be reason for that, but still we are facing the issue and we don’t even know why.
@Sour_Lemonade7 Oh yes I thought this time in court it will be diff but nope😪 no trust no communication how will they even have a relationship this way🤷‍♀️

Ah. Shit. I thought a solution to the no internet thing would be a hotspot, but there's no way I can afford the 200 gigs an Average American household uses.
friends join me in becoming a recluse in the middle of the woods where none of this matters, there is no internet connection, and we can hang out merrily for the rest of our livesi know ive said this before but being online is actually slowly killing us all :’)
It’s really depressing laying in bed 38 weeks pregnant listening to love songs  with your man 1000+ miles away with no communication. Not gonna lie.
@Ask_Spectrum Sorry, but why the fuck is the internet out again!?  It was out last night and back this morning. You got to do better than this.  "No internet access" my ass.  I'm in Koreatown, the heart of the city!#spectrumoutage

@CHSommers I recall reading about the 16th century English Puritans. They were a randy lot and went at it like bunnies (not much else to do, no internet) but there was always the unspoken assumption that if a child eventuated they'd both take care of it.
@youbroadband I have no internet and u claiming something elseChor company
AT&amp;T sucks!!  No internet for the second time in 5 days. @ATT   Was off three days last time. Wonder how many days it will be off this time. And they never compensate for time down.

@PapiYanni I have random moments of like no internet it’s really weird and rare but it happens
@Alydawne915 Yeah..I'm just sick of this whole black vs white crap you hear about everyday on the internet. This is why I miss the old days of the 1980s when there was no internet and you didn't get bashed for having an opinion.
@_AlohaMrHand I remember that Catholics vs Convicts game. What a build-up with no internet. Mike Stonebreaker with the crucial fumble recovery. What a fucking game.

@jediTfup so i have nothing no phone, no ps4, no going out(i barely go out anyways)
@Zack_Pearson It is. The players aren't the problem. The US have a vast plethora of talent. The coach who is actually motivating the players and is tactically arranging them is the problem. Quite simply the US didn't want it, there was no urgency, and there was no communication or unity.
@RubinReport No signal, the debate is all noise.
@earlyamhistory @ezraklein I agree in principle. Given that he has openly discussed trying to get out of there for years, it would surprise me if there was literally no communication, but maybe. Again, not sure what you do to prevent turkey from trying to clear the area. Now we are on to sanctions.
I don’t even have a show on when I sleep I literally leave my TV on No Signal.

@aymsent98 @MRobertsQLD @JWSpry @Tony__Heller There are multiple superimposed cycles, you can see them if you do a fourier analysis of the data, interestingly if you then add those waves back together you get a smoothed version of the same graph therefore there is no signal to show anthropogenic CO2 causing any change in it.
Bathrooms with no phone signal should be illegal
NO INTERNET SERVICE! VERY POOR SERVICE!@iamMVP @PLDT_Cares

In broadcasting, there is something called "Signal to Noise Ratio." Good systems have VERY LOW noise in comparison to the SIGNAL. Reduce the noise levels in your life, so that God's signals are stronger! Example: Some parts of Facebook/Twitter are ALL NOISE, and no signal! https://t.co/zXbn3OPevE

No phone in Greendale 53129. What’s the deal?
@pachi72 @BanksCori @madebygoogle The other concern is how that refresh rate, sensors and all the new stuff will impact the battery life. The Google Assistant part destroys all. No phone got that. Provided it works consistently.
Wore the same outfit today with no communication at all, this is getting out of hand 😂 https://t.co/OCNWc7VqQF

@Murda_Tv @JoshuaBlake78 It seemed pretty stable right outside the shop... just inside was potato af. I think all that metal (roof/walls) makes it even worse. My grandma has a tin roof and she gets basically no signal inside.

@AmericanAir Never made it to front of this line after 45 minutes. Your team has been unsupportive thus far. Even an AA stewardess waiting in line was upset. No communication. Me + dozens of others boarded a flight w/o knowing if we would make our connection. 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽 https://t.co/31iJaPr2Gi

Only thing about the #fightorfright event is that there is no communication between legends. At least the ping system would make everything much easier. The shadow's do a lot of damage, yeah, but actually knowing where to meet up/defend would be awesome. @PlayApex

@ElgatoSupport Yes it showed it was connected. But the screen was black. I tried it on my bros set up then, for him there was no signal at all. He connected the HD60 S back instead and al was fine. The S+ looks great, sadly only on papers. And the 4K utility has always been bad software
No internet again, fml.Anyways just finished watching The Witch at @klownqueen's place, love happy endings. :)

@WayneSleight Bird/Magic/Jordan/Malone/etc are from a different era. Different player culture. No internet. No social media. Only mass communication option was traditional media. Nobody from pre-internet era speaks up much. Only exceptions I can think of are Bill Russell &amp; Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

@drt15 Danny, as of Weds morning, no communication or instruction from SCG Trust as to how Stadium members redeem tickets to home game on Sunday at Leichardt. Makes it difficult to organise/attend match. Can you shed any light? Thanks
@itsabelslife I stand corrected. Legit excuse. I just presumed they had made little to no communication with you. I’m sure it will end up just as you planned. Good luck 😊
Hey guy I know from the local bar scene this is for you. Just because she weighed as much as two people that don’t mean you had a threesome so STFU about it. (Message will also be delivered in person I’m no internet tough guy)
.@unitiwireless it’s been pretty hard to get hold of you guys. Our incubator has had no internet for over 24hrs because of a forced hardware upgrade that went wrong - 17 businesses down and no customer service plan in place. Poor poor form.
In Nigeria, SOME service providers expect you to understand with them (based on - you know how naija be) on their delaying your job or failure to meetup, or poor services, with preplanned excuses (No light, no internet, staff jonsing etc), which should have been added to the cost

@ThreeUKSupport hi! I upgraded in store on the 23/9 to a new @Apple iPhone but I am still waiting for the preorder to come in. It’s been over 3 weeks and my contract has now ended on this phone. This is really disappointing from 3 and Apple and there has been no communication.😪
@Paula_White It is very bad communication. With no communication there is not much we can do. Sorry but that's correct. I hate letting people down. My mom said do not worry about anyone but please tell me there is somebody worth caring for. Please

But guess who is going straight home, doing her homework, and then spending the rest of the night in her room with no phone or tablet. This is embarrassing as a parent. I didn’t raise her to act like this.
i know why she did and it's a good reason but,, the way she treated me before just made it hurt 10x worse.. no communication hurt :(
@JustinFrankMD @gtconway3d And then a quiet place to sit and tweet...that has no internet. But,goodness, he doesn't need to know this, right?

One thing I dislike about the new @PlayApex event is that once the 10-man squad  teams up. There's absolutely no communication. Which I mean makes it difficult but still would be some way to get together as a team and communicate with each other. Even if it's only pinging.
I wanna play game but I still have no Internet ;-;

@tomiahonen The rest of his life locked in a shitty Motel 6 motel room with no phone, no TV, and no visitors except the deaf hipster who delivers vegan meals (his only source of food.)
@Apple Ever since I got my iPhone 11 I have like no signal everywhere I go. Places where I used to have full bars with my 7, I now get 2 bars. Are you guys going to do something about it? I know other iPhone 11 users with the same problem.
@MotherJones Perhaps, where snow &amp; cold are, governor, dressed in shorts, undershirt, &amp; flipflops, should be released from a facility with no money, no phone, just after midnight, in order to get real life experience.

Question of the day ...... what are you wanting..... how is someone to know if no communication is between one to another to figure out what they want. You hate the person.... so be it.. can’t stand looking at them..... so be it. Just say what is in your mind to them .
My family pays money for this shit(obviously). It's unacceptable for comcast to be so bad, we have long periods of no internet at all. Believe it or not, the reason my family pays for internet is not because we want no internet
it has been a long 4 days with no internet and no debit terminal, not so good for a retail business!  Thank you for your patience!  The Shaw drop to our building was knocked down by a tree in the storm and was just repaired!  It is business as usual as of 4:30 pm!

Im enjoying being phoneless
@DbDMemes I keep getting disconnected from matches because apparently I have no internet connection when I clearly do. It’s starting to really annoy me because I keep getting derailed because of it
@CashApp Its because when it rains, it pours with this app. No phone numbers at all, so WHEN you run into an issue you're gonna have to wait.With no money.No answers.No phone # to call.But the worst is the canned emails by people who are supposed to be working together, but arent.

@pintyhet Well in BC its super against the law to use your phone while driving. So that was enough of a “no phone” rule while driving for us :D
@glitchritual @LockeTribal ALSO A THOUGHT: are you using an adaptor or just HDMI&gt;DVI cable or little wire adaptor? Because unfortunately while DVI is capable of carrying both digital &amp; analogue, those won't convert &amp; could be why you're getting No Signal.

@jason0x21 I’m still pissed they took Navigon off the market. I need a fully featured, downloaded map app for my phone for the times I hit pockets with no signal like the area around my sons summer scout camp.
He's missing assignments and just not performing well overall. It's time for me to crack down and it's going to be harsh. No phone, no laptop, no PS4, no nice shoes or clothes, he'll have extra chores, etc. I don't want to do this but we've given him too many chances ☹️
@MissFlyByNight Look at this knucklehead — no signal.

“Poor people CAN save. No phone, no internet, no car, eat chicken pot pies, DONT GO OUTSIDE UNLESS FOR WORK, DO NOT reproduce, drink spit”
Expectation with no communication will have you put here with your feelings hurt.
@alanrew But we're seriously considering it anyway. We're starting to think that a slow internet connection might be better than no internet connection at all, which looks like it might be all that @virginmedia can offer.
@UK_CAA I was promised my direct debit payment in my bank account yesterday 14/10/19. No payment received no communication either really worried this isn’t going to be refunded. Friends who were joining us on holiday have had their refund over a week now!

@Grumpyrocker I love my 3a, but it has a problem sometimes that all the Pixels seem to have. It will say connected to WiFi, no Internet, but other devices have internet. Mine comes and goes, others have it a long while, maybe bc I change networks so often. Just had it tonight, then went away.

@advocate_jc Yes, but you have to realize that all of this is magnified now.  We have a 24 hour news cycle, social media platforms etc. that were not available in the past.  This has made everything that much worse...No social media, no internet, and news ONCE a day made it manageable.
@JonS_WF1 This is excellent. It nullifies one of the issues I have with services adopting it, but it doesn't fix the spatial locality issue (no phone battery? good luck). Postcodes get this right, but are lacking accuracy. Good solution might be a hybrid of the two. https://t.co/DnIhA9VuB0

A hunger for action leads to many an investor's downfall. Try an experiment. See if you can sit quietly in a room, just for 10 minutes. No books, no music, no phone, no computer, nothing. You might be surprised at how hard it is. Try it when the market is open

@G2GrabbZ Best rakan euw xD srsly this game was all about no communication and random moves until they remember they can group and fight as a team. Like "hey mate ! It's been so long ! "
Pt9: as if 1 phone call wud b enuf 2 get #Spectrum started on getting #Spectrum / #CharterCommunicationsInc fixing no internet instead getting calls apologizing etc and just making me more sick abot situation of #Spectrum keep my money althou no service provided.
@EmmaMattress absolutely appalling ‘customer service’. Have received no communication or response at all in under a month. I am going to return all and buy from @SimbaSleep @eve_sleep @Casper instead!
Yikes no internet or cell in most of Yosemite!
@VodafoneIreland You called me on the 8th Oct offering me a deal to switch my phone from eir. I accepted. Here we are and I still have no SIM card.  I’ve no phone as eir cut the service.  Live chat sent me to a store. They didn’t help. I called CS sat, nothing since. Please help.
@MRatedUK Cost might be low but signal isn't nearly as good as the other networks from what I hear from others. Been on EE for quite a few years myself and rarely find myself with no signal. Signal is nearly always 4G or H+ too.
After the week I’ve had.. damn laptop crashed. And I’m still phoneless so I gotta drive to Apple can’t even call.
It’s still very hard to not have you complain that no one is going to bother with your birthday cause mine is tomorrow. No phone call how Mike was nice and made you coffee and snuck a $20 behind Maria’s back as a… https://t.co/s1MpdQmNxQ
@sebaaide @BuddJenn @supergeenie No phone calls. You don't have the right to an attorney here.
@Zythen @BuddJenn No phone calls, sir. Strictly prohibited.
@AppleSupport I can’t cope with my phone not working properly. Since these new updates nothing updates my emails don’t come through notifications on social media doesn’t come though or it’s delayed. Then it says no internet connection. What’s happening?
Weekly digital challenge:1. No phone in bed                                          2.limit social media to 30 minutes total per day 3. Video streaming only once a day
In my mind, the DBG mass layoffs thing is just about the same as what they had going. Going forward, there will be little to no communication. Changes that do happen to the game will be not at all where they've needed to be and the same idiot is running development for the game
My phone please don’t do like this ooo..my back camera and flash light just stopped working and @VectorThaViper Dey share phone I Dey form big boy unto say I Dey use iPhone abeg no turn me to no phone 😭😭😭😭

Just FYI the pros/cons of committing vendor files (while working with cocoapods but applicable *mostly* generally):+ no internet needed to run/build the project+ no dependency (cocoapod) download issues - clone size- merge conflicts (when merging different pod versions)
Pt5: Knowing very well that #Spectrum 's follow thru might b questionable as 2 call notification left computer on from Noon until 6 PM wen I called 2 tell them no internet although got the call. Their resolution was to wanting 2 give me a Thurs tech visit to fix their problem
@JadeTaiXO Well Jade, I respect you so much as a business woman that I have no internet in supporting your safe business practices, since you cannot obtain insurance for the service you provide that I love to indulge in. Further more, it's not like I'm that eager to see you.

Well. In Ecuador till Saturday. What to do? What to do?A forest with no phone signal sounds nice right about now🤣
So missense mutations are under strong negative selection. But when you take variants that are common in chimps, there is no signal of selection pressure as you increase the frequency in humans.
@joelycett DPD delivery customer service is non-existent. No phone number to speak a person, just automated service. Their live chat is not an actual person either, automated again - it picks up key words from your text &amp; responds what it deems appropriately 🤷‍♀️ So frustrating
Pt4:they wud call 2 notify outage fixed. Call cam thru @ 4:30 PM but it was only 85% completed but were not ordered by #Spectrum / #CharterCommunicationsInc 2 go back &amp; fixed. instead #Spectrum was 2 call Tues AM those w/no internet following the fixing of the outage.

I’ve decided I’m going to file suit against @verizon for false advertisement and breach of contract. NOT superior coverage to any company. No signal in Concord MA center, parts of Waltham Belmont Boston &amp; more. I’ve screenshots showing locations and weak signal.
@thredUP_support @thredUP no phone support, no online chat support, email support takes 10 days, and no response on twitter.  Great company concept, but ZERO customer service. #badcustomerservice
@jupo1182 @wagon_hunter I think you are spot on, and a bad look for the refs, reminded me of the replacement refs... no communication on a scoring play.
Catfish is one of the stupidest show ever I ain’t never bout to be in no internet relationship
@taehh shutting my Wifi off at night with auto outlet timers, no phone in the bedroom, and not buying a house near an overhead power tower or a cell phone tower. etc. The latter is hard to do now.
@UK_CAA thanks to you I have now lost 2 holidays!I was due to pay my deposit with another company today they kept the price the same until today as was supposed to have automatic refund that I am eligible for! Had enough of the lies and no communication! Please sort this mess out

I always somehow end up phoneless I got the worsttttt luck w phones!
That no communication all day a turn off
@Hal_Duncan I spent half of 2004 in Australia with no phone whatsoever, and if you asked my to do it now I'd be dead in a week.
@UK_CAA I've phoned on the 13th to be told it should be in my account if paid by dd on the 14th october . I paid £5k on my holiday and I've had no contact about any of my automatic refund ,its pretty frustrating when you have a reference number but still no communication from you .
"How do they know a Shelby is here?" As he was stretching his legs, he tried to have a decent conversation with Moss. No phone calls meant he stayed quiet all day. A silent man will be a crazy man one day. Talking was vital for a human being. "Boy. People talk. One of the +

@Josh_Osgreat No internet sadly. Haven’t had it for about a year now
@LeeG810 Yes I'm glad too 😊I have a self imposed curfew of 7.30. No phone, no computer after that time.
Seems like @madebygoogle didn't fully learn their lesson with their price points. No phone is worth $1,000 and 64GB is too small. Anyone smart will wait a few months when Google struggles with sales and puts out promotions that cut the price to respectable levels. #Pixel4XL
Hey sorry I’ve had no phone :))
@MarzGurl Imagine a world where people like this have no internet access. It's a beautiful world.
#Acct111For tomorrow’s exam, you are allow to bring a four function calculator only. No advanced type is allowed. No phone is allowed in the exam room.
@bearbackvanilla @IrishRail Wow thanks, seems like we in self-driving AI train and we have lost communication to the outside world. 😉
This probably sounds silly, but there are lots of National Organization Of &lt;Specific Thing&gt; type websites on the Internet that are really hobby sites run by one person. If you have no phone number and no e-mail address, you look like one of those.

@virginmedia @Virgin_Victoria You guys definitely owe me the battle pass now for Fortnite &amp; Apex. Just spoken to one of your engineers and they said it is likely to be fixed on the 21st which is almost a week with no internet and most channels that I pay for. Even Sky wasnt that bad at fixing things 😂

@JeanetteJoy I can understand that. I get why people want them locked up, and we do have a gun safe. I mean I grew up in a different atmosphere. People beat their kids when they misbehaved and there was no internet to bully people with. Now's certainly a difficult time to grow up in.

@ATTBusinessCare why does it take 5 days for my company to be with out fiber &amp; voiceover for our phone and intervener. We can not function and no one cares! Multiple tickets in no phone calls returned ! We spend 7k a month with you and get nothing.
@goregirlfx Yeah so like for example, I got something from northern cali no problem, but Jeffree star lost power to his warehouse and there’s no internet (a few days ago) so they couldn’t ship anything out. So now theres a backlog I’m sure they’re getting threw. I think it’s luck of the draw
See that top right corner! 4G LTE= 4 bars = no internet connection. Every other app on the phone is fine except yours.

@sidbranca Or switch to paper only for a couple days (i.e. no Internet)? I've been doing that every once in a while this Fall. You get lots done for like a day, but then you completely lose sight of "reality" (i.e. what is happening online). 🤣

@Bronze60 @yveslavoieMTL @Cloden1 @ElectionsCan_F @MarcMillerVM While I understand this and visibly would call, I can think of at least 20 people in my neighborhood who sadly cannot for various reasons do this.

This whole era dating PERIOD is a pet peeve. mfs wanna do all the shit that married couples do AS FRIENDS. It’s no communication, no accommodation, no consideration. Quick love lost, people want to walk away and not fight for eachother anymore. All a wreck. https://t.co/1ZSisn8Z1k
@ImIncorrigible @bivviboy @Windows * Clock would only show a wrong value in windows if there is no internet connection, of course. As soon as there is internet the clock value is updated within seconds.
Won’t go back and forth dissin you on no internet
@CrunkComputing They are worth it if you utilize it well. I do lots of mountain biking and swim, and needed something takes a beating during biking, and is waterproof during laps that allows for BT headset directly to watch. Turn by turn gps w/o phone is nice at times if you have no signal.
Oh no... #Internet #nottoday https://t.co/wbcfNkpfbP
@UmemeLtd 24hours of no communicationAnd you guys now just put it up now?I thought after having no power in Gulu for a month we were going to have constant supplyBut it has turned worse
Hey there @virginmedia do you have a time frame for connections to be restored in Prestwich. No internet, phone or tv is rather problematic.
So BT in their infinite wisdom but not speed have given us internet for our house move, but then disconnected it because it can't quite hit 100 meg (which I didn't mind and expressed).So we now have 0 internet whilst I await a call to confirm we have no internet.
@willsommer A deviously clever way of keeping these disinformation memes around a long time IRL. No Internet needed which will be nice for when Russia turns off our power grid &amp; disables our Internet access.
@bt_uk So yeah I made the mistake of having @bt_uk as broadband and mobile provider. My reward is to have no internet until the 28th 🤦‍♀️

@turo I have been trying to contact your support for 5 days. Your chat doesn't work. I sent you a private message. There is no phone number to call. Shouldn't be this hard to give you my business.
@wheatfrom @LoyalDefender2K @UKLabour I had no proof of address, no job, no phone number... only one bank would give me a bank account. Good old Co-op.After that I could get a job, rent a flat...I was a struggling working mum on zero hour contracts. Not always a spare £10/ £100 for ID/ passport knocking around😟

@NTSNewsDesk @NewsThisSecond No, I have not. I was told by KU Police dispatch that the evacuation order did not come from them, but from Facilities Operations. That was why there was no phone alert, only a PA system announcement in the building. That seems odd to me.
@OlisaOsega Seriously.I can't be in a relationship with someone when there's no communication.I crave attention and it comes through communication.

The idea of cloud gaming kind of makes me nervous, though. Because once the Internet goes down, no gaming. And that's literally what I do when I have no Internet (especially with me being a TV cord-cutter).
Having no phone for 3 days showed me how much peace you can have!

@vrbo Still no phone call. Renters beware  that line item “property fee” may be “accidental damage protection” required by owner.

@Hal_Duncan Last time I went camping in the boondocks during road-construction season and forgot to bring my road atlas. Had to fumble my way home with no signal, just sense of direction and vague memories of the route I had gone in the opposite direction on the way out. (Main road closed.)

@nitin_gadkari On expressways with barricades on both sides with no signal anywhere, even a vehicle at 120kmph can be controlled. The problem arises when idiots halt, jump lanes or gather in groups and drive like herd of buffaloes without leaving space for others.

@ragincrinz @GoogleStadia I really like the IDEA of stadia: it's a streaming platform and you don't need a high powered PC, because they supply everything on their end, but I'm concerned that it's all exclusive digital content, how do i access it if i have no internet, or what if stadia goes away.

"Nomophobia" is the new entrant to the Oxford English Dictionary.

@mileslunn @VoiceOfFranky @darrellbricker @RebeccaYNot @JudgeGort @markcritch @EricGrenierCBC @22_Minutes @niknanos I forget where I read this as it's a few years old now but apparently the US election miss was largely attributed to off the grid voters (no phone altogether, and limited internet for online polls). Seems reasonable to me but just my opinion that it makes sense.
Per   @NetShutdowns    here have been no internet shutdowns reported in #India since August 25, 2019. Is this correct? Great if true. India  has shut the net 77 times in 2019.
MTS: No internet no phone since Oct 1.  I have a home business.  No one even has an estimate of repair. I am told its "complicated".  One of the complicating factors is they need permission to dig from Hydro. This is quite comical as no buried lines here. what are digging for?

@miksullivan No communication is the worst. Shed the lower tier of customers, and learn to recognise the signs. Fear not a ruthless hand. The next time this customer returns, (if they do), your prices have gone up. You’re just too costly now. Recommend a competitor, &amp; smile as they leave.

Seems FO-29 had been active on Sunday,Oct.13 ?(I heard no signal then.) https://t.co/7lf8ifmpvE
@Lowes 2.  I spent countless hours waiting for appliance deliveries that never happened.  A manager lied to me, accused me of not returning a call and the delivery folks admitted that there is no communication and that the system is messed up.  Left loose hose=water everywhere.
registration form: phone number is optionalcheckout: the chosen address has no phone numberwell because you said it's fucking optional
@hkbutyr Go ahead bro! Just ban everything - Facebook, Instagram and even Twitter. HK people (and even some politically apathetic HK pigs) will immediately come out if there’s no internet!

Phantom Vibration Syndrome is the name given when someone thinks their phone is vibrating but isn’t.
@tomiahonen @KIResists No TV, no Internet,  no phone,  no Twitter, no visitors, no parole of his  1000 years in prison in isolation with Pence in the next cell with echoes of his Bible readings in the Isolation Ward.
@HathwayBrdband This is karunakar Reddy with account number 1147426710. I reported no internet connection issue. And there is no resolution even after 48 hours. Every time i call your customer care they say will resolve in 24 hours. One guy came and took away the modem.
@bt_uk appalling service from BT. Moving home in a week, but BT stopped all our services yesterday because our buyer set up services with another provider. No warning from BT, didn’t ask us, now no internet (I work from home). Refuse to reconnect, offered £20 compensation. Avoid!
@GlideStudent hello! the wifi is sort of working on my phone, but on my laptop it shows that there's no Internet connection
@virginmedia @virginmedia Shocking service , all our 27 phone lines have now been down for 8 days, we have been phoning every department with no resolution!!!! How can we run a sales organisation with no phone lines?????
@PaulMadras Sorry Virgin has been down so no telly, no internet. Thought I'd go crackers.
Its been 70 days of curfew in Kashmir, millions of people are living with no communication, the brutality of Indian govt is still going on the innocent lives of Kashmiris.#Kashmir2KhalistanMarchInGENEVA
I'll be away for a while (No Internet access) doing research for my next book. ☮️💛 https://t.co/rrsTNKgYUA

@VodafoneUK Hi. Had parcel delivered today. PlayStation plus a Sony experia 5 but there’s no phone in the package. Please can you advise?
@Safaricom_Care I moved from Zuku to safaricom home fibre and it seems like I was digging my own grave! 2weeks after installation and still no signal! Fix it or refund my cash! Acc no.:11084708
@StarTimes_Ng you are busy updating where there is no signal on ur DTT platform. You guys remove stations without notice. If am paying #1,900 monthly n I don't av access to FOX what's d useful. More reason u guys can't compete with DSTV. You will lose more customers soonest.
Damn no signal at home plus no privacy what.
Having NO Internet was the best time to grow up!
@VodafoneIN @VodafoneIdeaIN @IdeaCellularLtd @vodafoneidea @idea_cares your service in Pune has become beyond poor. You will not believe number of customers on the verge pf porting out. What are you doing? No communication from you of any sort!!!
Gagu almost 1 day no phone lmao
What the heck @Lenovo @Lenovo_in who ships a product after 2 months of order? You should have given me the exp date of dispatch before placing the order. There is no phone customer support to resolve. Quiet frustrating. Cancel my order without any deductions. @forum_consumer https://t.co/sGDp9Hc2su
@EBAthunder Autumn 2019 sessions are due to start this Saturday, October 19th, why there is no communication? Which location? Who's the coach? What's happening???
@BobLoukas Work in a room with no windows. No phone. Disconnected from the internet. Most programming exercises only require a book. If you need to download libraries, get them on a USB drive from another computer. Compartmentalize your work from play.
I've been in a place like this, twisting yourself into a pretzel and beyond.  It's how you become an insane person.  Like, do you have communication with these people?  You're going to relativise your behaviour to people you have no communication with and I'm off the NBA.
what if i did roblox commissions bro why do i think about this stuff when i cant even draw yet (still no phone ecks dEE-)of course ill uhh draw friends for free unless they insist on spending ro b u x  mmyesi miss you guys
@MJT1963 There are always reasons why someone may be unable to jump thru a hoop.Example person A is housebound with no internet. Maybe infirm with age. Requires help from council to go out. But council had to cancel homehelp.
@bigolbur @SeaOfThieves Surprisingly no. Phone stayed pretty cool. https://t.co/MfGuUUunuy
My new number is for business purposes only not for you nats as far as you know I’m still phoneless

@VodafoneIreland can someone PLEASE let me know when the issue regarding receiving activation codes from bank of ireland will be resolved!!! This is now a great inconvenience with no communication and the 'it's a priority ' answer given on the  chat!!

So I finally decide to move to @EE  hoping for better customer service My new phone has been delivered to the ‘wrong address’ TWICE Both days resulting in me waiting in 2 days in a row and still have no phone #rantover https://t.co/NUQjZPECgf
@ArcherBM @Rachelle_jdh @RichSementa @marklevinshow The situation has been made a lot worse. You want our troops to do for u when there's no communication to anybody when greenlighting the Turks to attack in the first place. Are the military forces around the world supposed to have a crystal ball for your presidents stupidity?
The older I get, the more I fantasise about retreating to a log cabin somewhere out in the middle of the woods, or on top of a mountain. No Internet, phone calls or television. Just my books, thoughts and the nourishment of nature. 🔥🏞
I have to send my phone off today to recycle so I can buy a new phone (iPhone 8 because I'm poor) so I will be phoneless for two or 3 DAYS
@seanljt @justicemachaba All to my damn self . Especially this house . It needs so much solitude. Soft music , books , organic food . No phone or laptop . Just me

@ACTFibernet No internet from 2 weeks
@jonlis1 A walk is good especially if there's no phone reception - enjoy leaving it all behind ..for a while:-)
My mom just told me I got a wedding invitation sent to their house. Had her open it and turns out it's from a girl I haven't seen or spoken to since HS graduation. 18 years of no communication and suddenly this bitch wants me to buy her a toaster?!🤔🤨 #TuesdayThoughts

Jio and others have stolen money of their internet usage for all these months.
Cool I have no internet until possibly Sunday. Good times...
@nxcare How does the bus not show up? And with no communication to all the customers? Finally, after waiting for half an hour, I was forced to call an UBER and go to the airport, fearing every moment that I will miss my flight. An absolutely ridiculous way of operating.
I actually feel European are paying more attention to #digitalwellness than our fellow American https://t.co/pyUw39KEcj
@nxcare Another A2 towards Luton came, the driver refused to help and connect with the service for A6. The services were HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING. There was absolutely no communication from National Express even on the chat. The live tracker system for the coach was not working.
@ArifCRafiq SMS/ texting services already stopped. No internet or prepaid phone service. Yesterday a group of peaceful women protesters arrested. Sect 144 in place everywhere. Security forces in every nook and corner. The kind of normalcy India loves to see in Kashmir.
68% of the #people suffer from Phantom Vibration #Syndrome, the feeling that one’s phone is #vibrating when it’s not..... #psychology #psychologyfacts #entrepreneur #entrepreneurlife #facts #life
So, connectivity in my office is down.Because we are "integrated" - no servers, no wifi, no phone. I cant do anything except read mail from my cellphone.
I hate having a credit card because i have almost 0 self control, but since i have no money and no phone well it´s time to get a fucking credit card.there goes my perfect credit score lady´s and gents

@oVertoneColor I emailed you three times in the last week and sent a message on Instagram. You have NO phone number to call with questions. Your product didn’t work and you won’t respond to me. What gives? That is terrible customer service.
@_hoshua_ Still got no internet 😂
@SwvlKenya your app got issues?? I can't log in...each time I try it fails citing 'no internet' despite having a stable network

Solitude experiment.  $10,000 to stay here for a month. 1 neighbor. No internet, electricity and cell phone. Enough food and supplies including lotion for your skin for 30 days delivered by bucket. Can bring books. I have a pet.  You accept? https://t.co/eJRIGYjHXv

@virginmedia why is service in N20 so awful? On and off for weeks now &amp; only joined late Aug. With no internet or home phone home working is impossible. Help desk useless. Get it fixed.
@bt_uk Thanks Sharon, just panicked as need it down to have broadband as no signal at it on mobile 😂
Gais if you want to message me, jangan whatsapp because got no phone right now
You can't convince me that BTS felt dissatisfied with the way AMAs handled their first US performance because they haven't gone back since then and they set other activities on the same date this is like how they dont go to Gaon after the no signal shit
Apologies everyone, we have had no internet services for over 3 hours. Only the best (not) for the Aust ppl. Thanks Scott.Also if some using this 4 dating site, sorry try Tinder &amp; be a gentleman .
Streamlabs wouldn’t let me go live...so while looking and trying to fix it I saw that reinstalling nvidia sometimes works...now both my monitors say there is no signal found...GeForce really fucked up my display ports😐GGs only bc idk when I’ll be able to fix it🤟🏼😞

@RainCoZa How does this work? This happens every single day. No connectivity. No internet. Can’t even run a simple speed test 🤷🏽‍♂️ https://t.co/eVapTgN55P
@HomeAffairsSA visited Barrick St CPT today to renew passport, the place is falling apart.1 photocopier barely working, toilets broken, posters falling, no communication on site or online .... your house looks like a mess, its hard to believe you are in control. #motsoaledi
