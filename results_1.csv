@MissAshes92 Glad to hear there is a gate. I haven't passed there in a while. This is a good site for a camera, compared to radar/laser gauges. Agree, underwater gauges are more susceptible to water and debris damage, and thus a false or no signal. You can tie that in to ATX.Floods.
@xSoulHunterDKx @DayZ @NakedByo For them to make it this far. Without the people who purchased the game, they wouldn't be where they are. It's a great game, incredible in my own opinion.

@Sinkopedia I (and you probably) grew up as the internet became mainstream. We are all still adapting and only certain lines have become obvious, like no social media for those under 18.That said, porn blockers and a curated internet for those under 18 is understandable. No internet is not.

@WizardWhistle No phone is more durable than another tbh. Put on a tempered glass, use a good case, and dont bring it near water ever. Phone batteries will always degrade with time/use but the Note 10 battery is the best out of these choices.

@PurolatorHelp No card...no phone call...please examine how I'm suppose to know I have a package in!? Most times I don't even know which courier a company is shipping to us with. I have to run all over town trying to find my packages. I will insist on companies not using Purolator to avoid this
Week two with no phone and it‚Äôs been a struggle
@PurolatorHelp There was no card. So no card, no phone call. Am I suppose to be a mind reader?? 2 WEEKS IT WAS THERE. So I finally go get it and with my back out, carry the 70 lb. package up the stairs.  If this was the first time this happened that would be one thing but it has happened before
It seems like every month that I have to deal with @GetSpectrum outages or some kind of interruption due to crap equipment. No internet or cable for a second day. https://t.co/Lp8s1gQFhT
@PurolatorHelp I was told there was no phone call by your depot because the phone number wasn't in the label. I contacted the company I bought the item from and they say they sent it and you didnt put it on
@Scottcrates @ResisterSis20 Luxury prison with no internet, only classic books. They serve only RAW vegan food. Goat Yoga class is mandatory, as is the strict no makeup or hair products policy. Hey. Hell is what hurts the most. This is his Hell. https://t.co/N2vcHVZx0T
@PurolatorHelp Shipping by courier is to get items fast. I have been waiting and calling trying to find my package to find out it has been sitting FOR 2 WEEKS at the depot. No card at my office (and it was open the day you claim you attempted delivery) and no phone call...
@hsieh_zachary Dang I actually need it I have no phone just a I pad
@OptimumHelp going on 5.5 hours with no internet or cable and no response? Also sent DM with no reply

@SKYserves Youre testing my patience again. There is still no internet as of this day! Location is not even on the list.

@gram63 @BBCRadio3 *runs up and down boat hysterically at the thought of no internet...again*
@IndiGo6E our flight (Bombay to Delhi) has been delayed. No communication and heads up given to us about this.
@_woollyback @RokoshME @united_roll @Lumberist So although I see the need to reduce, I also see that we are improving. If you want to help so desperately you might want to look at what you can do, no internet, no phone, no fridge, no runners, no synthetic fibres,canoes, bikes, trains, cars etc! We still need to live
This guy just cut in front of me w no signal and then proceeded to go UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT WHY

@NippySweetyLass Yeah, but there's no Internet in woods and therefore, no Twitter for him to throw around his wisdom...
There should be no phones so you don't bitch why there is no faculty in your deptt. There should be no phone so you wouldn't shoot what ABVP does in your campuses. There shouldn't be phone so you don't post your grievances with SSC on twitter. There shouldn't be phone at all.

@NitrateVille I looked into this. No internet here but Comcast, cutting to just internet and adding a streaming tv service is roughly the same price as keeping the service I have, and the cloud DVR services on streaming are extremely limited

@MissAshes92 Glad to hear there is a gate. I haven't passed there in a while. This is a good site for a camera, compared to radar/laser gauges. Agree, underwater gauges are more susceptible to water and debris damage, and thus a false or no signal. You can tie that in to ATX.Floods.
@xSoulHunterDKx @DayZ @NakedByo For them to make it this far. Without the people who purchased the game, they wouldn't be where they are. It's a great game, incredible in my own opinion. But for about a week, it's been in a broken state, with no communication on the situation. Only a sales pitch. Not cool.

@MJairosi No signal is needed to be given to start the rebellion. Spontaneous reactions from people all over Zimbabwe will do. If you organise a date and place the junta will counter and put security or even ban. That's the reason why at any hint of protest police are thrown in the roads

@ThreeUK Please help me out here, my phone still has no signal despite turning it off and on countless times. I've even traveled from the I.O.W to Surrey with still no sign of any signal. To add to this, my three phone number was meant to be transferred from my old three sim

@MissAshes92 Glad to hear there is a gate. I haven't passed there in a while. This is a good site for a camera, compared to radar/laser gauges. Agree, underwater gauges are more susceptible to water and debris damage, and thus a false or no signal. You can tie that in to ATX.Floods.
@xSoulHunterDKx @DayZ @NakedByo For them to make it this far. Without the people who purchased the game, they wouldn't be where they are. It's a great game, incredible in my own opinion.

It's not that I love Android, because I don't. It's just that I don't like iOS. I tried the Ubuntuphone, but as soon I booted the thing for the first time, I saw the complete failure of it. So I went back to Android. It's either that or no phone at all. https://t.co/8WHHgsqzni

@TabithaKhaye No phone, no fb, no communication, except twitter really, so often I just venture out hoping to run into somebody, but alas, either they also avoiding the slander, drama, etc, or I just don't matter that much I guess, except to be pestered, and annoyed.. *Le Sigh* Fml, now I am
@dana_howl Love the idea... but i would like to see it executed using a $10 budget and no internet access.$50 per month is what most of us already are doing (or would like to be doing)

What is the thought process whereby a person decides to text another person they barely know after 4 yrs of no communication? Do ppl just scroll through their contacts and randomly text ppl? I'm curious abt this but not curious enough to respond to the random that just texted me https://t.co/69Q2B3AJH0
@pulte @PulteDaily I might be without power and all contact if pg&amp;e moves their shutoff line even half a mile, no phone Wi-Fi nothing. A cheap hotel for the weekend would be a blessing
@shivers_raymond @matthewfleming @Da3LeggedFreak @TheDivisionGame Go into a discovery raid match make tell me how that goes.

Week two with no phone and it‚Äôs been a struggle
@PurolatorHelp There was no card. So no card, no phone call. Am I suppose to be a mind reader?? 2 WEEKS IT WAS THERE. So I finally go get it and with my back out, carry the 70 lb. package up the stairs.  If this was the first time this happened that would be one thing but it has happened before

@sebas05000 @ari_bloch @JohnLegere @NevilleRay Typically poor quality SINR and RSRQ I suspect are the issues in this area.  Looks like T-Mobile must be actually working on it today - no signal from that site.. but typically getting 3/5 'bars' from a site up on the hill.  Overlay in this area may be the key.

Dear #RealEstate industry,You really need to start putting the ISP's available and the internet speed packages available where a house is located. It's just as, if not more important, than the school systems. I wouldn't move to a house that has slow/no internet.
@SunTrust Hey Suntrust fraud department , when I disputed a transaction 2 weeks ago, and now you finally decide to fix it, how about letting your customer know you shut down their debit card instead of letting them find out in public.  No email...no phone call...you suck.  0 NPS.

There should be no phones so you don't bitch why there is no faculty in your deptt. There should be no phone so you wouldn't shoot what ABVP does in your campuses. There shouldn't be phone so you don't post your grievances with SSC on twitter. There shouldn't be phone at all.

@wojo4hitz @teganandsara Ik ik I think this no phone rule focuses more on the artist‚Äôs perception of the audience instead of the audience‚Äôs perception of the artist, like a mechanism to have a more intimate show. It kinda sucks for people like me who can‚Äôt go but I respect it though

There‚Äôs always a lot of wasted time due to miscommunication or no communication at all. I wish people just understood that being vocal is the best way to resolve anything.

I hate the company rn who are setting up glass Fibre in the surrounding area. They cut our line the second time now. Last time I couldn't even call someone for 2 weeks (no internet either). And now the same caseI pay 40 Eur for 16k (get 13k) and it's down often -_-
Being without power is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, no classes so I get to sleep in, on the other, after I sleep in I‚Äôve got all this free time to do almost nothing because I have no power and no internet. So cold showers it is I guess
But the Internet is back, and so I can get to uploading that video that I wanted to upload on freaking Monday and is now very overdue. My work has been curtailed by 2 weeks of no Internet. So has my partner's. It's been ridiculous.
Interestingly, she didn't seem inclined to do anything about this until we contacted our landlord after a week of no Internet to find out wtf was going on. Only then did she actually start working on getting the problem fixed.
@pbaines86 And I though I was having a bad day - no phone thanks to a Three outage and the exhaust dropping off my car. Luckily I got it to the garage becasue breaking down with no phone would have been too much fun for words!!
I wanted to upload my video today but I had no internet, ig I'll do it now
@whiskeyrich Haha now I said that it says 4G but still no internet doh

@mjshrimper It's TV that calls the tune, and the clubs have been stupid enough to cede total control to it for bucks. No one, that's no one, will be surprised if they are not out today. And still no communication.

@cathaypacific @AmericanAir just had the first part of my 30+ hour flight cancelled for mechanical issues. Neither airline has been helpful at all in re-booking. No communication about flights or hotels. I have gold status with American and need to get back to the US for a weddin

@ThreeUK This is now ridiculous. When will the network be restored? I have no signal at all and it is disrupting my work.
@ThreeUK do you have any updates on when the signal will be up and running again? No signal since 8am this morning.
my house is more boring than school rn, having no internet sucks ass
#ThreeUK would this outage affect my phone, am on holiday in Mallorca, suddenly no signal.
No Internet &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Slow internet
@ThreeUK No emails. No texts and no phone so no contact with anyone outside of my home. Hope there‚Äôs not an emergency
@MustardSeedUK @ThreeUK Absolutely, this morning I had no signal whatsoever, restarting the phone got a signal, but no data access. The last one was country wide as well, but didn‚Äôt seem to get picked up by journalists.
@mariebudgie1 I had that the other night off Sky. No Internet or land line.

@ruskin147 @ThreeUK Mine was back about 9:30am in Edinburgh - way better than the last time this happened a few weeks back when I had several days of no internet. Seriously considering changing provider after two big outages.

@Ord_Norm_Bloke Do not go with EE! I‚Äôve got no signal half of the time and it‚Äôs so so crap with everything else and I‚Äôm paying way too much
@markcoxdavies Hmmmmm is this why I had no signal from about midnight until about 9am this morning?! I too was grumbling!!!
Well... the longer I'm with @ThreeUK the more I'm thinking I shouldn't be. I've been looking at the Samsung S10 5G and now I'm thinking I should be looking at it on @EE, better price and I've still got no signal, meaning I have had no signal for 12 hours.
@manxiouslife Maybe so but they should have been on the ball on Twitter etc to update folks.  Piss poor customer service. Of course networks can go down but they need to be on it. The internet is workable but no phone service is bad
@UK_CAA what is happening about automatic refunds for DD from Thomas Cook. No communication from you. Still owed money for a fully paid holiday. Have put a claim in. Still no communication. Some old information. Need update.

@ThreeUK Nearing the end of a contract with you and whilst no 4G in area (Rural), HSDPA (3.5G) has been surprisingly good. Last few days there was no signal at all (very frustrating) until late last night. But 8/10 for overall usage. Shame there's no 4G though.
@ThreeUKSupport I‚Äôve had no signal since last night, no idea if anyone has been trying to contact me. I‚Äôm hoping customers will be compensated for this.

@Tutor_Eduonix the site is down and I can't access anything. At moments like these, I wish I had the option to download my course's contents so that I could work offline. Whether I were to have no internet, or if the site was down... Any ETA of when it's back online?

@ThreeUK Intermittent implies a service that comes and goes at irregular intervals. It's been close to 11 hours of no signal now, absolute fucking joke!
@daveirl @noxiousjellyfis @sweetoblivion26 Because you get on a Bus Eireann bus in the middle of nowhere where there's no Internet for the driver's machine to connect to, the money needs to already be on the card.
@ThreeUK Don't we know it my signal was right off this morning and no Internet either hope you get it sorted

@LD_P Yessss nothing worse than having a phone stolen and then still having a two year contract to pay but no phone!
@ThreeUKSupport I‚Äôve had little or no signal since 11am Tuesday, looked on your website to see their was a problem with a local mast and should be fixed in 5 hours. Signal had barely come back and now this? üôÑüò†
@syswarren I know. So, since at home you have no internet, you have no internet at work. You got it? üòâ

"Perhaps [...] we're more used to medicalized terminology for mental states, and also perhaps because we are in a time with a lot of change and uncertainty. Being able to name feelings might give some comfort and start some conversations." - @lynneguist https://t.co/bDxTMWsbIw
@EE hi üëã I just wondering is there any issues with the network at the moment? As I literally have no signal what so ever. I‚Äôm able send this as using Tesco WiFi
@Hardywolf359 They don't care, non of them do. When O2 updated my local mast they shut the cell down for over a month. I had no phone or internet connection in office. Had to drive 3 mile up road to next cell to retrieve/send emails, phone calls. They gave me a months credit on line rental.
@Rudeboy_Rich @jcampbell_05 @BBCBenThompson @SkyBreakinNews @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport @BBCBreakfast I will never ever go back to Vodafone. I left them in 2016 after 19 years. I‚Äôd sooner use a bit of string and some cans. Their customer service was monumentally poor. 3 have been very good until recently, now lots of days with no signal, no apologies. Are they going bust?
@OliHudson1990 @DanChecklin @ThreeUK He can't. He got no internet üòÇüòÇ

I just had a great idea last night for a VR (Virtual Reality) experience (that's what apps are called for VR):VR Unplugged: you are in a virtual reality simulation where you aren't using technology...no phone, no computer, no tablet, no TV. Ironic, right? https://t.co/STmbKjXA0E
@ThreeUK Had problems this morning no signal at all.

@jjfox123 @BarbaraRich_law @AlessandraAster Very quiet, minimal conversation IMO and definitely no phone calls (the latter is expressly specified). Loud conversation, laughter, playing music or videos all out IMO.
@ThreeUK You've been having these "difficulties" since yesterday.Unacceptable, absolutely no communication with your customers whatsoever.
@MoneySavingExp I constantly have no signal
@ThreeUKSupport It seems a little better now. But generally speaking, over the last month my coverage has been worse than usual. Often find myself with no signal now.
@leemel @ThreeUKSupport Minutes after I posted this, @threeuk's mobile network completely died. No internet all night until the early hours of the morning. #threedown  #threemobile #threeuk where did all the money of your profits go for the last two years. Clearly you stopped investing in London...
@ThreeUK  I seem to be the only one who got a text saying ‚Äòexpect disruption in the area...‚Äô got to say, @ThreeUK do a brilliant job, so a few hours no Internet is no biggie #quietniceactually

@1daavi No phone beats Samsung Galaxy 10+

@ThreeUK Any information about this outage would be great. You are very good at letting us know what you do well but when in trouble it‚Äôs radio silence. Unacceptable in this age. 10hrs no signal. #threedown https://t.co/EmnDLHHM6q

@ThreeUKSupport Seriously frustrating. No internet. intermittent phone service. Customer services. Not even reachable
Might have little to no signal today. So if I don‚Äôt reply that‚Äôs why.
@ThreeUK Currently... I‚Äôve had no signal from three since 12am gonna have to start working faster than that since my signal has slowly been getting worse the past few weeks now I have none... maybe 8+ years with @ThreeUK is enough
@ThreeUK  i am thinking about leaving this shitty network. Poor service and no communication with customers about issues üò°üò°üò°
No phone call yet ü§î
So Three is down and my WiFi is a piece of shit soooo no internet for me
@ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK Your customer service is shocking! I‚Äôve been with you for 8 years now and even just upgraded my contract to get unlimited internet. Since then, I got no internet and very poor signal. It‚Äôs been more than a week now and no compensation given!!!
@svlaimcn @ThreeUK SAME THING W ME my data won‚Äôt work and there‚Äôs no signal
@KetagalanMedia @praimetiz Children with no internet literacy even be able to access, but hardly to avoid risks protect themselves. That requires more than high school graduated knowledge.Spreading digital literacy and skill is further important than just setting up the channels.
@ThreeUKSupport Well I won‚Äôt be upgrading at the end of the year, I get bad signal at home and almost no signal work and now this happens.
@ThreeUKSupport no signal midnight on both my phones. What is going on?
@Grasshopper2049 Guess what?  I just lucked out!!!!   I will be in the Caribbean during that time with no Internet access.  Please stop crying...you are getting me upset.

@IsaiahXMills @JayMack3301 @gay_rural @mva1985 @ewarren Don't be obtuse, Isaiah. SOCIETY agrees what "blue" means in a given context and that verbs conjugate based on nouns not adjectives.  Without agreement there can be no communication.
Woke up to no signal, got it back and then lost it. It's just returned but I don't know how long for. This is a rollercoaster of emotions. I was not prepared. If you're reading this... stay strong... be safe #threedown
@ThreeUK some technical difficulties?More like no internet no texts no out going calls and couldn‚Äôt receive incoming calls ! Phone has been dead since 9pm last night!! Apologies will not cover this #threedown #threemobile this morning you will be losing some customers incl me üò°
@ThreeUK From about midnights I noticed my phone trying to find service, then when it reconnected my 4g was on but had no internet, how long will it be down as I‚Äôm paying money but I can even use what I‚Äôm paying for. My 4g is the only internet in the house.
@ThreeUKSupport can yous check whats happening no signal no access to the internet calls or texts my postcode is DN1 1LU
I‚Äôve had literally no signal the whole time we‚Äôve been in London n it‚Äôs so frustrating pls.
#threedown not only is my internet connection down but also keep losing the whole service as a whole....

@ThreeUK I have no signal whatsoever - I have had to logon to Twitter via my work laptop to check what the problem is as I haven't got access to WiFi been at work.
Got home and there is no internet connection. You know that sticker that shows that one fursona slamming his head on a desk. Thats my mood rn.
@iD_Mobile_UK NO SIGNAL THIS IS RIDICULOUS

@ThreeUKSupport Litterally cannot use my phone at all no signal, no data nothing

@ThreeUK 12 hours non service. EE ship is rammed as we speak. Been a month if crappy service now. Slow speeds, no signal now this. #leavethreejoinEE
@ThreeUK Not just the UK, am in US for work and no signal or data for around 10 hours here too. I get that things go wrong every now and again, but how you deal with it is critical - no information for 9 hours is not the right way. Tell us what the problem is and when it will be fixed.
This whole morning no internet. Then they‚Äôll come and tell me I should get a new SIM. Nah sort your crap network out
Thank you to everyone who wished me a very good birthday! Sorry i took long to reply. I had no internet yesterday:(  but thank you again everyone! https://t.co/M7kJkCtviq

@ThreeUKSupport Not that you need more complaints but to let you know, having the same issues up in Aberdeen too since last night. No signal at all or 3/4G. Always just says "searching" or says I'm "offline" even if there is allegedly 4G. 3 App won't work either.
No phone calls and no data! What is going on 3 mobile? üò°
@ThreeUK network used to be so good but I swear to god recently almost every week my internet goes down or I get no signal and I‚Äôm constantly having to look online to check network converage. Dunno why I pay ¬£60+ a month for a fucking network that never works properly
@ThreeUKSupport How can we check back here with no signal?
Ha!Ten hours with no internetAs you might gather, it is back on now https://t.co/K4wlUZE8lC
#threedown tough and annoying it needs to be sorted quickly, if an operator has a global outage then this is a genuine concern far greater than no internet, I‚Äôm now more worried about my data being secure.

Nice one @ThreeUK , no signal, no data, no communication. Cheers.
@ThreeUKSupport No internet from 11:30 last night as far as I can tell. I use this for my home broadband and work from home so it's a vital service.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport very annoying after 3 years of continuous contract, the service is getting worse day by day. No internet at all, used around 2GB out of 12GB last month. Currently using WiFi :(
Have no internet at my plac right now, I fucking hope it's temporary and it wasn't the drilling on the flat next door breaking some wall cable
@ThreeUKSupport No phone signal whatsoever ü§¨

@ThreeUKSupport can you please give us updates as there‚Äôs still no signal?
@MrMatRead @IWMTom @mister_surname @ThreeUKSupport Wi-Fi doesn't solve the issue of no signal to make calls and texts. And Wi-Fi is only at home. Not sure why you don't see "the issue". I'm not too bothered about the outage but I can understand it could get really inconvenient for some people.
@ThreeUK Ffs fix up I have no internet service
@ThreeUK Best network for data? I‚Äôve had no signal since last night....
@priyasethibjp @MehboobaMufti @Shehla_Rashid @kavita_krishnan What a joke? U asking will they protest or condemn, but in reality u have cage them and no Internet. A lady protested yesterday, detained by BJP Pro. Anything happens, bjp : will so and so....! Enough of politics of insanity.
Kmt as soon as I get off this train I‚Äôll have no signal. Stupid @ThreeUK

Knbs should pay the enumerators who worked tirelessly in the just concluded census. In Bomet we're in total darkness. No one understands what's going on. No communication from the relevant offices @KNBS
@ThreeUK what's happening! No internet cant make calls, tried your online network issues apparently your doing work! Really poor show, no answer when calling either. I've only got another 17 months to go with you üò•
Having no phone service after the concert was a bloody nightmare couldn‚Äôt get hold of my family to let them know I was fine and couldn‚Äôt check the bus times üôÑ @ThreeUK
Only I would get stuck on the Eastside, by myself, at 4am , with no phone .... smh
No signal at all for hours now, website unavailable and the signal's been dodgy for months.. this isn't what we are paying for @ThreeUK
@somersetseahawk @ThreeUK 3g started working around 8:30am, but no internet access. Imagine if you had to call 999 not impressed at all. A text message to all customers would have set the right expectation. Their risk manager should get fired !! That's not how you run a business.
No signal 3 is skatty as fuck
From now on whoever I kick it with we need like a no phone policy , mfs can stare at screen in the crib
No internet.By the time you read this, your thoughts and prayers will no longer be needed.
@ThreeUK Only been with you guys less than 3 months, bloody great start!! No phone when working night shift doesn't help if family need me..sort this ASAP!!!!

Once I leave yard, no internet until I get to uni ü•¥
@Rchaud1 @ThreeUK No internet? Really? In 2019 and you can‚Äôt get onto the internet? Pubs, hotels, Starbucks, Costa, loads of places you could take advantage of free Wi-Fi . Unless you have a home based Ethernet only PC,but then you wouldn‚Äôt be using three would you ?
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport no signal/data all the way from Crawley to Croydon! When's this going to be fixed? It's clear it's not specific areas and it's you're entire network!
@ThreeUKSupport When is this going to be fixed? I‚Äôm in Oz. Bit me and my wife (maybe both not 3 for long) no signal all day. No nav. No way to call home without stopping at McDonald‚Äôs WiFi. First denying an issue then accepting there is an issue but with no timescale. #uselessthreenetwork
@ACTFibernet No Internet since 24 hours. Registered a complaint but nobody response from your side. üòíüòíüòí
@VodafoneUK So I‚Äôve been stressed thinking my phone had been hacked, no signal. Reset my phone to factory settings. All the stress of setting up all my online banking apps and security. Not being able to contact my kids whilst away in Spain and you feel ¬£5 is adequate?
@ThreeUKSupport Hi Three, no signal in North Lincolnshire, come on get on it.
More @ThreeUKSupport problems! Kind of getting used to it now. No internet signal since before midnight! @Three_Is_Broken #5gFailhttps://t.co/31AiP4DVnp

Hey @ThreeUK &amp; @ThreeUKSupport , any reason why I either have no signal at all in central London this morning? It's been on and off all morning but off fully for the past half hour. It's kind of ridiculous.
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport pathetic attempt to fix the network. 9 hours and counting. no signal, data or ability to call. disgrace
@ThreeUK No internet from yesterday üòñAnd when you try to ring 333 - no answer........
Have to say I laughed a bit reading the suns article this morning about @ThreeUK I am with 3 and get no signal a lot it‚Äôs a constant problem but turning my phone off and on again works ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è why has everyone got to ‚Äúloose their minds‚Äù over it ü§£ü§£
@Airtel_Presence @airtelindia Hey.. I'm travelling in Berlin, Germany. I have activated your international roaming pack. There has been no signal this morning (~2 hrs now). The Airtel app isn't helping.Can someone give an update?

@ThreeUK It's been troubling with trains services not working from Euston this morning and trying to figure out how to reach my destination with no internet. Well done 3
@ThreeUK Mine was down since 10 pm last night. NO CALL, NO INTERNET AND NO MESSAGES IN OR OUT. WHAT A JOKE!!!!!
@RVP2020ASAP @Boxing_Exposure Hahah If there was no internet you would be  A NOBODY.
@ThreeUK Considering I was parked on the side of the motorway last night, with no signal, no means of contacting anyone, not even 999 despite it saying emergency calls only... This is of little use to me now. Cheers!
@ThreeUK 9 hours with no signal what a joke !!!!!
So, at 6am this morning I had signal, by the time I got to work 40 minutes later, no signal. #threedown We don't have wifi at work so basically if shit goes down with the kids today I can't respond to our WhatsApp group. Hopefully no one gets punched! @ThreeUKSupport
Yeah it's a bit of a pain that @ThreeUK is down - but these things happen, no phone network is bulletproof. I'm sure it'll be okay eventually.#ThreeDown
No service and no Internet in Upper Holloway area in London for nine hour now @ThreeUKSupport ü§¨
@ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport can we get an explanation of what's happening pls? My phone has no signal at all and I use it for work so I'm already not receiving any clients calls today which means I'm losing income. When will the network be up again pls?
@iD_Mobile_UK does your network have an issue with getting signal today? I‚Äôm in Bristol area and have no signal. Just checking it‚Äôs not my actual phone
Today there is no internet and I have computational class
@BBCBreakfast About time too. Fuming that they blame customers and our devices when it's literally everyone that can't get on, and when I did have signal (none now) there was no Internet.How they act now will decide whether I demand to leave my contract as my phone is essential as a carer.
@ThreeUK How can we check for updates when we have no internet....
No internet connection for hours. Now been knocked off network. What's going on????? @ThreeUK  #threedown
@ThreeUKSupport My phone network has been down since midnight last night,I have no signal,no internet and can't top up,your website says you are doing essential work,where Timbuktu?
Only me would be on the network that has went down x no phone for me today lol x
@ThreeUK No phone working at all since yesterday , presumably all our bills  will be adjusted accordingly ?  Tried contacting you via your website but it‚Äôs not working
@Zuku_WeCare I have given up. Now my decoder has been saying no signal for a week after some rain. Ata kama nimejipeana aje siwezi. This relationship has become abusive and exploitative. :-(
@Mama_Crocker_ I mean I‚Äôm not denying it‚Äôs not ideal, that‚Äôs for sure, but people are complaining at no signal at 1am...Unless it‚Äôs an emergency or you work nights, you don‚Äôt need your phone at 1am üòÇ
@iD_Mobile_UK @ThreeUK Just to clarify: I have phone service and my phone can even 'see' 4G, but it can't connect to 4G so no internet. Phone calls and SMS are working.
lool the whole three network is down ffs, no internet all day
@ThreeUKSupport any idea when the network will be up again? No internet since late last night
@ThreeUKSupport No signal AGAIN. This is now a CONSTANT. What am I paying for exactly??

@BBCBenThompson just heard your report about 3 network. I had no signal when I checked earlier.  Restarted phone and signal returned immediately. @BBCBreakfast
@ThreeUK frustrating as there's no signal. Had to come home after school run to check my WhatsApp and emails as most of my work communicatiin is via them. On call with 3 support for 30 mins still waiting. Pathetic as nothing has been communicated by three
@ThreeUK this network is a joke. No signal half the time and now absolutely zero updates. #StrikeThree #ImOut

@ThreeUKSupport no signal what so ever, whats going on? üò¨
@TheYoungFello Weird, but in a good way.  We were stoners and beer drinkers, but not because it was cool, but because we   had not cell phones, no internet, and especially no social media to tell us what was what.  They will never know that freedom.  I‚Äôm still optimistic about our future.
@ThreeUKSupport are there widespread network issues? Writing from bury/Manchester UK. Showing no signal voice or data.
@virginmedia Nope.  I've run all the tests and it says there's no issue.  I have no internet, still though.
Three has completely stopped working - my mobile dongle has no signal and my Mac says there is no ‚Äúcoverage‚Äô - Reading media on phone seems that Three are in a complete mess. https://t.co/LsBSdY7Zoa

To be fair, in the years I‚Äôve been on #threemobile this rarely happens, but:1. It‚Äôs v.inconvenient if you‚Äôre not connected to WiFi all day2. Yes, some of us do need to contactable 3. 999 doesn‚Äôt work4. No communication from @ThreeUK informing us how long it will take to fix
@ThreeUKSupport my phone has no data and no signal, it's usually pretty poor coverage but its gone today.

@virginmedia According to your app perfect! Vs reality, absolutely nothing, no phone/tv/broadband!

@ThreeUK Network problems not just confined to UK. I'm in the US for work and same issues, no signal or data for 8 hours or so. I accept that things go awry sometimes, but providing no update or information for your customers whatsoever is unforgivably poor service. #threedown
Oh dear @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport no internet in Stoke or Stockport. I got a signal for a few minutes whilst the train passed through Macclesfield on my morning commute, but poor show guys. #SortItOut please

A little rant here, I have no internet connection at home since sunday and my provider @SKYserves won't bring their service team to fix the damn problem they never disclosed about, I'm so mad I'm paying my internet bills timely and this is what I get in return ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

If I remember correctly, maybe 9 games. No internet access, no demo disks, retailers not getting their shipments and were so pissed they didn't restock when the original allotment sold out (if it did at all)...it was an utter disaster! Really, it's lucky we got it at all.
Over 12hrs now I've had no signal on my phone. Couldn't do my job last night and lost alot of money. No warning or even apology from 3. Shove your contract up your arse, I'm going back to EE

No power since 10.30 AM. No communication.Expected 2 resume 2.00 PM.Delhi giving 24 hrs power with lowest tarrif. Contrary UP Govt. propose to hike tarrif with such poor quality of supplies. An example of New India. Sad @ptshrikant @myogiadityanath @PMOIndia

@ThreeUK can you let us know if here in forest Hill SE23 where we have no phone service at all, is this because of works in Hither Green and how long we‚Äôll be affected?? Urgent please!!
No phone signal at all, extinction rebellions making commuting to the wharf near impossible. Happy Thursday everyone üòÅüòÅ
@justaddScott Yep, and also in so many areas of the country there's only 1 or 2 choices of ISP. Because there's zero competition, there's no incentive to provide quality service if someone's choice is bad internet or no internet at all. We need to break up the oligopolies.
@IrwinTessa @GMB Hopefully she‚Äôs on the tube on her way to uni with no signal &amp; will contact you soon
@Jared_Greenall @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK nothing in huddersfield. Can we have some idea ease as to what's happening? Sounds like it's been going on a while with no communication from you guys.....

@ThreeUKSupport any chance of fixing or at least letting customers know what's wrong with the network? Shoddy service. On nightshift with no phone is hell.
I think the real issue is the complete radio silence for 8 hours.No communication with customers is the real problem. https://t.co/WqfIH72sFL
Back to work after almost two weeks off. No phone signal, ffs @ThreeUKSupport sort it out please. #threedown #findmewifi ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

@ThreeUK  what the he‚Äôll is going on. I‚Äôve got 6 contracts with you and non can be used due to no signal. My boyfriend relies on his phone for work and I rely on my sons as he has disabilities. I hope your giving some compensation out as I‚Äôm paying around ¬£200 a month to you.
@edcurwen @seanfarrington @three @BBCBenThompson Someone woke up the maintenance chap at last. To be fair, the CEO text him about it at 11pm, but the guy had no signal so...
They‚Äôre not playing with the no phone policy
Fluctuating signals + no internet for the ENTIRE morning.It‚Äôs no wonder they offer the best data plans, because you can never use it!
No internet since today morning. Been relying on wifi since. I still don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm with @ThreeUK

@BBCBenThompson @ThreeUK @ThreeUKSupport @BBCBreakfast I'm on call with BBC News today, I've no signal which means I have to stay near wifi. All @ThreeUK say is to use their app to make and receive internet calls. They used to have great coverage but its slowly become unusable
No internet and can't make phone calls, both of which I need for work.Cheers @ThreeUK
@ThreeUKSupport @ThreeUK no signal anywhere what's going on!?!?

@ThreeUKSupport outage in Durham! Says SIM not provisioned. When will this be fixed? I have no data and no signal!
@BBCBreakfast It's annoying that theres been no communication about it, but my world isn't ending. Never had any issues with #three so far and they're bound to have technical issues at some point. By far the most pleasant staff to deal with at three, I just renewed off the back of this alone.
Paying ¬£70 a month to three just to have no signal üôÇü§°
#threemobile #ThreeUK  Funny how I have had  NO signal since last night you‚Äôre website down for reporting faults &amp; yet the store is open for new Mobile purchases &amp; the best the computer has managed to take the money from my bank !!!!  #getagrip ü§¨ü§Ø
@BBCBreakfast No signal since late last night. Can connect to WiFi but no use when not at home. No 3G or 4g. Interested to see what 3 will do, probably not a great deal.

@TGP_Ethan why do you get no signal in your house
Paying @ThreeUK ¬£50 a month for no signal, quality that.
Anyone else on @ThreeUK got no signal. Nightmare.
Middle finger up to Three, shittiest phone provider EVER! How is there four bars of signal one moment and then no signal for the next 20 minutes?!!!
@ThreeUKSupport why has my home WiFi stopped working all of a sudden?! No Internet at all!! #ThreeDown
@TwitterBusiness Why am I locked out my account because some one tried to compromise it and I can‚Äôt get it back as the email connected to it is no longer valid? I have no phone data to receive a text code so Why am I screwed? Had to make an new account NOT HAPPY with lack of support.

@KyrstinBush @JeffreeStar I know that the had no internet all week end due to fires in Cali, so things have been slow. Theyre probably shipping the boxes out individually by size
@ATrinKTVU @zaphodsbud @USGSShakeAlert @GavinNewsom @Cal_OES I lived in Santa Clara, Ca during the Loma Prieta Quake. I‚Äôve never been so scared IN MY LIFE!  The worst part of it was the ‚Äúnot knowing‚Äù what was going on because we had no phone, no TV, no Radio and all we could hear were sirens all night.  Frightening!
@ThreeUKSupport come off it no signal?

@Tesla your customer service is terrible at best. Drop my $80k car off at 8am to have a console installed. Told they will call me and send an Uber no later than 2pm for me to pick up. No phone calls or updates all day. No way to reach anyone at center.
@Marcg306 @pshyco_panda @TheBeardstone @gojizilla29 @madebygoogle Also I literally said the iPhone has been in development since last year as it was leaked towards the end so obviously I know a phone isn‚Äôt made in a fucking day. You just think I‚Äôm an Apple fanboy and want to try and ‚Äúcrush‚Äù me. I owe no phone loyalty. I see the similarities.
The terrible feeling of having no internet connection.
No direct lines into the supervisor. They promise to call and they don‚Äôt. They keep me waiting on hold for over 1hr and 45mins yesterday alone. Time is money but they don‚Äôt care. I have probably spent over 10hours being passed around and still no internet setup - ouch
all day we waited and no one showed up or called, again it happened on Tuesday Oct 15th. You ask to speak to supervisors they don‚Äôt call u back you escalate it further and no one calls - Horrible Customer service and still no internet installation
@murderlexx no phone, who dis?
had no internet for the last hour and i lost my mind. but im fine :p
@Chime Glad I didn't have to pay bills today. Although I couldn't really do anything else either. You guys need to give some kind of credit for this outage.Not only that but no one can get in contact with customer service and there has been no communication outside of Twitter. Wth guys

@LeNorthSnobby @YankeeSopranooo @debow316 @mklein176 Certainly doesn‚Äôt help with the emergence of the smartphone. Growing up in the 2000s Yankee Stadium was so damn deafening no matter what time of year. Part of it certainly was because everyone was into the game. No surfing the internet, no social media, no phone games, etc.
Still no internet!!!
I remember working and being into my music and the internet cut off. Supervisor came and asked me if my computer was up and the nigga jumped out of me. I said ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt got no internet right now‚Äù

No phone should have an ultra wide lens wider than 17 mm. Framing with the iPhone 13mm takes skill most people, including me, don‚Äôt have.
I guess the time for the lock down was 50, 60,70 years back. No mobile,no internet,no social media. It would not have been anything to chafe about and art 370 could have been abrogated in a most cordial manner @naukarshah https://t.co/6Etn6pfoaC
@SwvlKenya Its easy but please work on your app.. Its saying no internet connection even on wifi... I was left today at 5am and got to office very late. The driver did not even call me
So 5 minutes later I realised I had no phone. It flew over the dumpster with the rest of the trash. I ran back to the spot, the dump track was just about to pick up the trash, I desperately searched through the trash, when the driver went out and dialed my number.
@AlliSpeed All the drivers ! I remember when I built mine and I had no internet after downloading the network drives over and over.
@SKYserves Until now there‚Äôs no internet in taguig. Why?
@Morrisons my order is on its way right on time yet you can see from the time on my phone it‚Äôs already 10 minutes late no phone call or message to inform me https://t.co/qmbChS7ucQ
If you came by the stream i ended early will be back on later today it‚Äôs really not fun playing with randoms when no communication is there
@KevinTurveyRIP @RupertLowe10 @6am Funny, when i was living in paris in the 90s ( working, proper  job n all, taxpayer etc..) I was pro brexit.. No internet there.. No trolls either.. Funny, those that have actually been there and lived it have a different opinion. Why is that?
Having no phone and using this iPad is TRASH
I was released nearing the departure time from DTLA of the last 733 back to Venice's with no money, no phone and no means to contact anyone expecting me to serve more time who might've helped me.
@patchychilli Nope, still no signal but fans still light up and gpu fans spinsBut no monitors/keyboard+mouse lights work

I had been within the Scottish Highlands the other day, on a car trip with your family with simply no network on my small Pixel 2 phone. Essentially, I had been stop from all of those other world. No internet, no messages, no calls.  #iPhone #iphone4 #iPh https://t.co/S5FXLI1p3Y https://t.co/lOwgDNzfYx
So, my entire village has no electricity, which means no internet to work from home, no water as it gets pumped by electricity, no food (can't get takeaway coz phone doesn't work at home and the restaurants can't cook), no tv... So, I found a  spot on the beach with internet...
#wednesdaymorning #WednesdayMotivation Well I avoided social media but still had an unproductive night. But hey sometimes you start chatting and are surprised at how quickly 7 hours just flies by. But tomorrow no Internet, mean it this time... #WednesdayWisdom #wednesdaythoughts
It‚Äôs ridiculous how productive I can be with 2 hours of early morning uninterrupted time. No slack. No phone. No emails. üí™üèº
@sssonku All the time spent with no internet is about to come to fruition. Challenge accepted
Was that a bought of nomophobia, @TopCellularDeal? My low-battery anxiety usually kicks in at about 19%, so that's why I thought this was a fantastic idea https://t.co/R44E9Wuk0S #realworld
@CstZhalovaga @Windermere_VSB @VSB39 @VancouverPD There was no internet when I was in school in the early 1960s and we survived. People talked to each other, kinda a novel idea.
Being alone in a big house with no internet...in a new country...with no friends...is next level depression and anxiety

@PsalMissF Lol l totally agree.  People like to do whatever they want like there are no consequences.  They expect everything with little to no work, and they expect understanding with no communication.  All of it amazes me but l will always do what is necessary even if others don't...
@Troubl37 mine does something equally awesome..Goes to sleep,like half a second before I sit back on itthen decides that I have no internet connection and I have to restart.

@TowerCrosley DMC is a disaster. there is no communication about which classes are necessary, and no clear path forward. seniors are terrified for their future. even the professors have no idea what to tell me. it all feels so meaningless.

In broadcasting, there is something called "Signal to Noise Ratio." Good systems have VERY LOW noise in comparison to the SIGNAL. Reduce the noise levels in your life, so that God's signals are stronger! Example: Some parts of Facebook/Twitter are ALL NOISE, and no signal! https://t.co/zXbn3OPevE

A hunger for action leads to many an investor's downfall. Try an experiment. See if you can sit quietly in a room, just for 10 minutes. No books, no music, no phone, no computer, nothing. You might be surprised at how hard it is. Try it when the market is open

Hey there @virginmedia do you have a time frame for connections to be restored in Prestwich. No internet, phone or tv is rather problematic.
So BT in their infinite wisdom but not speed have given us internet for our house move, but then disconnected it because it can't quite hit 100 meg (which I didn't mind and expressed).So we now have 0 internet whilst I await a call to confirm we have no internet.
@willsommer A deviously clever way of keeping these disinformation memes around a long time IRL. No Internet needed which will be nice for when Russia turns off our power grid &amp; disables our Internet access.

@mileslunn @VoiceOfFranky @darrellbricker @RebeccaYNot @JudgeGort @markcritch @EricGrenierCBC @22_Minutes @niknanos I forget where I read this as it's a few years old now but apparently the US election miss was largely attributed to off the grid voters (no phone altogether, and limited internet for online polls). Seems reasonable to me but just my opinion that it makes sense.
Per   @NetShutdowns    here have been no internet shutdowns reported in #India since August 25, 2019. Is this correct? Great if true. India  has shut the net 77 times in 2019.
MTS: No internet no phone since Oct 1.  I have a home business.  No one even has an estimate of repair. I am told its "complicated".  One of the complicating factors is they need permission to dig from Hydro. This is quite comical as no buried lines here. what are digging for?

@miksullivan No communication is the worst. Shed the lower tier of customers, and learn to recognise the signs. Fear not a ruthless hand. The next time this customer returns, (if they do), your prices have gone up. You‚Äôre just too costly now. Recommend a competitor, &amp; smile as they leave.

@JHBWater @HermanMashaba we've had no water in Weltevredenpark since 2pm yesterday and have had no communication as to why. Typical, pathetic service once again!
@DeanBlandino Explain to us how in this day and age, no communication happens in game to inform a ref that he made a bad call and that he‚Äôs seeing something incorrectly. It‚Äôs ludicrous that the bad call against Flowers can be REPEATED at the worst possible time. How can that be Dean?

@CricketSupport have been losing service off and on since September 22nd. No internet, texting or calls. Except emergency only. Random times throughout the day

@CoxHelp . As a Bourbon Street business owner it's impossible to do business with cox. If it isn't down which is at least twice a day it has no signal. Time to switch to ATT. Don't use cox business.
@TravisCravey No Internet &amp; electricity = glorious and most noble act of sacrifice on my part.
@JudiGatson This morning I literally  had a big buck fall off the railroad trussel on Gervais street in front of my car I slammed on brakes or he would have been on my hood. He broke his leg. Some guy on sidewalk saw it and got him off road alive. No photo as no phone on then

@ShawInfo can you give any update when services will start to work in Portage la Prairie please?  We got power back last night but still no phone or anything. Thanks.
The answer is yes. I mean, it's $10,000, but... why no electricity? I get no internet or cell phone, but I know people who vacation and live in places so isolated, you have to take a pontoon plane to get there, and they have generators and solar panels... That just seems dumb. https://t.co/SY4x7aNCC9
Brand-new service installed in a  brand-new house with brand-new connections and brand-new modem recommended by @Xfinity, yet NO INTERNET SERVICE. That's called breach of contract, and I will pursue legal remedy.
Having no internet connection is also great for you get to have a chance to self-reflect and do other things than just checking what's up on the social media. üòâ

@UK_CAA @alexgear4 CAA are you advising people with the correct information? I was due to fly 25/09/2019 Thomas Cook package holiday paid by direct debit. 7 payments! No communication at all only what seems like empty promises from the tweet feed. Granted you are busy but...

@ChuckWendig Be pretty boring. You'd have to have a giant stack of books. No phone? What about emergencies? Nope.
@DrSimEvans @FintanSlye_eso ... opinion there is an issue when developers have no incentive to site their wind farms where the impact on grid resilience is minimal.The lowest costs for consumers don't come from a world where there is no signal that accounts for the impacts of intermittency.
The thing that sucks is there is basically no outlet to fight for that with @AirCanada. No phone numbers, no human contact, just emails and Twitter DMs. And no way of expediting the process. Only vague statements and a 6 week waiting process. 2/2
@TruthRaiderHQ Gold doesn't do anything useful? Well, it doesn't corrode, and it holds its value. SOMEBODY wants it, because our whole planet's been after it since Genesis 2:10. I like #Bitcoin; but it doesn't do @Jack if the system collapses. How you gonna verify transactions with no internet?
Something, something snowstorm and no phone service (pre cellphones) The kicker is that my mom's friend didn't call the police because the didn't want her daughter's boyfriend to get arrested because of some law about transporting minors across state lines

@Samoth12 the reality is their premise is flawed because if you have a month of food and no electricity it means you are going to live off rice and beans, no meat or veg. They should have just said 'electricity but no internet' and that's functionally what they are going for in 2019.

@Coryxvx to go phoneless, i agree
@qfbpk @3Days3Nights @martingeddes @SticknTQGETHER Study for how long for breakdown and people start to go nutz has already been done.  Trying to remember but I think one of the key time frames was 72 hours if there are no communication with the outside areas or no hope.
Sick of ringing up, to be on for over an hour to be told there is nothing wrong. @TalkTalk over had no internet for over an hr. Their solution keep note of when you lose signal.üò°

@PFF_Moo @KevinColePFF @benbbaldwin Yeah, I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs no signal. Just that the signal we care about is indirect. A QB can make terrible reads but have god-level accuracy and complete 70% of his passes with +10% CPOE, or make god-level reads and have mediocre accuracy and complete 70% with -5% CPOE.

I've seen a lot of stuff posted about #Dartmoor this year. People seem to think it's some kind of playground for idiots countrywide. It's not. Get some respect for the moors. It's a dangerous place, no safer than 50 yrs ago. And your phone won't save you when there is no signal
@thehill we wish you were on an island of onewith no phone service
@TMobileHelp I live in Herndon, VA and commute everyday from Tysons Corner. Along route 7, the signal is terribly low, sometimes no signal at all. This has been an ongoing situation since I switched to TMobile in 2016. When I was with ATT, I never had signal issues.

No Internet no streaming, gg
@CR221 I remember the one time I slammed my bedroom door and my parents took it off the hinges and I received a punishment of NO phone for 2 weeks. My dad was military, simultaneously cuddly and stern. I didn't get the door back for 2 months. I never tried that one again.

@GKam84 Nope, you turn up and sit in the waiting area until you're called, then if not selected from those called up, back to the waiting room. No phone, no computers - so take a good book or 3, some good trainers and a cushion to make them civil service chairs bearable. And crap food!

Selling Orbit 2.0 with no communication regarding a comeback, a reality show, OT12 variety appearances, V-Lives, social media, literally anything? It‚Äôs not a good look and I‚Äôm severely disappointed.
They built up momentum and lost it all just as quickly. They‚Äôre a rookie group and a six month hiatus is unheard of. Their large global fanbase sets them apart but a half of year with no communication jeopardizes all of that. BBC is fucking up.

@DhyInn Idk I unplugged and reset everything, but still didn‚Äôt work, so I left it for like an hour or so and then started working again. I think it might be a problem with the network provider and not the router bc I could connect to the router, but there was just no internet.

@JuliettGulf @vashmcl TSTT came and installed their WiFi system by us (we did not ask for it). So there's no landline anymore, guess what? When there isn't any electricity from T&amp;TEC there is no phone service.

@semii_semi Nvk would be banned too then, if stuff from years ago resulted in a ban currently. The only reason we‚Äôre complaining so much is because we don‚Äôt even know why he was banned, no communication with actual evidence. Just ‚Äútoxic behaviour‚Äù that could have been present or years ago.

@hotroast221 i hear peeing on things around the place is a good way to let other residents know youre upset with something thats going on, and its a no communication method, they just have to figure out what to do to appease you or you pee on more things in greater quantities. source: cats

@sh_irredeemable @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump @RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerPelosi It's amazing how silent the media is about central California the 800,000 plus that are without power which means - no water, no communication, no food, no stores open, no gas ...totally cut off.

@cabot_w @BernadetteNoBot @Mel_Ankoly That‚Äôs why the candidates campaign. Think about campaigning for president in 1936. No tv, no internet, not a lot of face time with candidates because they had to travel by train or car. And vehicle travel was Ltd by lack of highways. People listened to the radio &amp; read the paper
Love my life. No internet cap

@Nidhi So what did the govt. achieve by depriving ordinary citizens the right of communication for 70+ days? Why no internet? What do they fear? Will all phones be tapped now? Was this infrastructure being put in place?When will armed forces be removed from every street and corner?
Facebook, my email, WhatsApp&amp; jus about everythin on my phone is acting wacky cause it's retiring...so I'll b phoneless...

@PMIevents @PMInstitute Why was @RogerLMartin not at the conference? I think it's very strange that there was no communication whatsoever about his replacement?
No communication, no leadership, athleticism over sound fundamentals and IQ, a dependence on 3 &amp; 4 man pressures. This defense that was doomed to fail from the start.

@WatchVRV why do I keep paying for a service that runs worse than most pirate websites? Third day of services being down and no communication. I'm having a hard time finding reasons to continue my subscription
- writing lines- kneeling in the corner- do a chore alone - quiet time - no phone- cold shower- slap on the wrist- no social media- extra turns walking the dog- act of service for Daddy- time in the crate- sit on the floor instead of the couch- wash my mouth out1/2
Please tell me there is something better than no internet security and being denied access to my account because I can't remember the security answer I used three years ago. Then when I try to create a new account, I can't , because that email already has an account.

@KathyONeill9 Last time they hit our communications line (no internet no phone). The phone company tried to give us a hard time but I pulled out that little diagram the locators leave, and that was proof enough for them not to charge us to replace the line.
@ieo_96 @ra_boscan I know it's true iPhone users are like that.  Because they use broken iMessage because iMessage sucks at communicating with most phones.  If iPhone users would stop using broken iMessage and use anything else there would be no communication trouble between iPhones and Androids.

@discobabe76 @stoner1968 @bessacarrali @georgegalloway @realDonaldTrump @BorisJohnson The real aims of what became the EU.

I told my family to vote out, because I knew about the hoped-for aims.

@IJohnson_TNF @Dobbln @ThreeUK Massive sudden drop off in reception for me too. Like I have no signal in Leicester Square or Soho, which seems crazy. Turning off 4G helps, I think they're massively over congested (despite saying they upgraded their network backbone for 5G)

@ThreeUK Hi. Data signal has always been v bad at London Euston but this week I have had no signal at all until a few minutes out of the station on a train. Is this a known problem? It is in stations that you often need data to most (to check alternate routes etc). Thanks.

@jpembroke If you have asked and she's not doing it I'd say that is defiance and therefore no internet for a period of time is a suitable punishment.  Perhaps the first time 1hr and increase by an hour each time she is defiant???

The reason I say this is because back then there was no social media, no 24 hour news media, no internet, etc., as powerful mediums to gaslight the masses, push propaganda, &amp; instigate more infighting between Americans. Yet, the divide was just if not worse especially w/ Vietnam.

@nupuralankaar Why are you complaining now? Kashmiris are in lockdown for the last 2 months. They have no money, no medicines, no mobile service, no internet. And what kind of indian are you?

i need to pay my insurance this no phone shit so lame i cant even check on my baby while i be atwork ima pay my shit friday
@xeni I was only 8, but: no internet back then, no social media, no 24 hour cable news, &amp; only 4 stations on TV. So people only got updates during the nightly news on TV and in the newspapers each morning. So it probably wasn't so tedious since people looked forward to the next update.
@ShayanNabi This rascal says no internet. Then how did u tweet ? Probably someone from Papistan doing or he may be getting signals from them

@DurhamComplete there is a traffic signal warrant for crossings adjacent to schools which is why that signal could be installed. At other places, you need at least 75+ crossings in a given location to get a signal (and if there is no signal, are 75 people really ever going to cross there?)

@SuddenlinkHelp when you address the outage in Northern California? We've had no internet for 2 days now. Website says there's an outage, but no other info.
@xeni This is tedious? R u kidding? This is a roller coaster ride through a haunted house where a crazy clown keeps leaping out and laughing maniacally!  3 networks and  the AP unless you lived in NYC or DC and NO internet!  It‚Äôs was SLOW. Could live your life at the same time.
@puyochron the only pokestop near my home is the welcome sign to my neighborhood... there's also a park, but there's no signal there so that pokestop is effectively useless. pokemon go is not friendly to people who dont live in an urban center,

@newhall89 @JnxOuaquaga @Dawnmillward2 I realize it now but not back then in 1997 when I was 26 and there was no Internet and I had no idea about adoption stuff and had no guide.

Day 7, Again no internet. I call @FrontierCorp and go through the process of restarting the router...Its the OP and they cannot fix it remotely because it will interfere with other users in my building. Surprise I received another "Ticket" and apology.
Day 4, Still no internet connection. I call @FrontierCorp and am given another "Ticket " and apology. Day 5, same. Day 6, I finally have internet connection. I text and cancel technical support for the 7th.
Day 3, No internet. I call @FrontierCorp again and and am given another "Ticket " and told a tech will arrive on the 11th. No, I say,    so the earliest a tech can arrive is the 7th. Again we go through the process of restarting the router.
I'm given a "Ticket" meaning my complaint is recorded. Now I'm instructed to describe the lights on the router /motem  and to unplug and plug connections. Still no internet connection. I'm given the standard apology and told to call back if needed.
All seems fine. two hours later no service. I call wait 20 min. to be told it's the OP. ? And they will email me the instructions for resetting router ( I have no internet). Day 2. No connection. I call @FrontierCorp and am told  it's your model or OP?

@ATT is an absolute joke. They have missed 2 internet installs with no phone call or email notice. Kept me on hold for 90 mins only to give me no answer. This is how they treat new customers, so it only goes downhill from here. Absolutely Disgraceful.

@EricaJong @POLITICOMag Without a doubt, Steve Bannon is the sleaziest person in politics today. This bastard ditched his wife and daughter for a year and a half, no child support, no address, and no phone number. During that time, he had $500k  in his checking account.
